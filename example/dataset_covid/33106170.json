{"doc_id": "33106170", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "BCG revaccination of health workers in Brazil to improve innate immune responses against COVID-19: A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.\nThe BCG vaccine, widely used in Brazil in new-borns, induces adjuvant protection for several diseases, including childhood virus infections.\nBCG activates monocytes and innate memory NK cells which are crucial for the antiviral immune response.\nTherefore, strategies to prevent COVID-19 in health workers (HW) should be carried out to prevent them becoming unwell so that they can continue to work during the pandemic.\nThe hypothesis is that BCG will improve the innate immune response and prevent symptomatic infection or COVID-19 severity.\nThe primary objective is to verify the effectiveness and safety of the BCG vaccine to prevent or reduce incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the city of Goi\u00e2nia (Brazil) among HW previously vaccinated with BCG and also its severity and mortality during the pandemic of the disease.\nSecondary objectives are to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 among these professionals and the innate immune response elicited to BCG.\nTRIAL DESIGN : This a phase II trial for repositioning BCG as a preventive strategy against COVID-19.\nThe trial is an open-label, parallel-group randomised clinical trial, comparing HW vaccinated with BCG and HW not vaccinated.\nThe trial will recruit 800 HW of Goi\u00e2nia - Goi\u00e1s, Brazil to reach a total of 400 HW included after comorbidities questioning and laboratorial evaluation.\nEligibility criteria: Any HW presenting BCG vaccination scar with direct contact with suspected COVID-19 patients for at least 8 hours per week, whether in hospital beds, ICU, or in transportation or admission (nurses, doctors, physiotherapists, nutritionists, receptionists, etc.) who have negative IgM and IgG COVID-19 test.\nParticipants with any of the following characteristics will be excluded: - Have had in the last fifteen days any signs or symptoms of virus infection, including COVID-19; - Have had fever in the last fifteen days; - Have been vaccinated fifteen days before the inclusion; - Have a history or confirmation of any immunosuppressive disease such as HIV, presented solid tumour in the last two years or autoimmune diseases; - Are under preventive medication with antibiotics, steroid anti-inflammatories, or chemotherapy; - Have less than 500 neutrophils per mL of blood; - Have previously been diagnosed with tuberculosis; - Are breastfeeding or pregnant; - Are younger than 18 years old; - Are participating as an investigator in this clinical trial.\nINTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR : HW will be randomized into the BCG vaccinated group or the BCG unvaccinated control group.\nThe BCG vaccinated group will receive in the right arm, intradermally, a one off dose of 0.1 mL corresponding to approximately 2 x105 to 8 x105 CFU of live, freeze-dried, attenuated BCG Moscow 361-I, Bacillus Calmette Guerin vaccine (Serum Institute of India PVT.\nLTD.).\nThe unvaccinated control group will not be vaccinated.\nThe HW allocated in both groups will be followed up at specific times points until 180 days post inclusion.\nThe vaccinated and control groups will be compared according to COVID-19 related outcomes.\nMAIN OUTCOMES : The primary outcomes are the incidence coefficient of infection by SARS-CoV-2 determined by RT-PCR of naso-oropharyngeal swab specimen or rapid lateral flow IgG and IgM test, and presence of general COVID-19 symptoms, disease severity and admission to hospital during the 180 days of follow up.\nThe secondary outcome is the innate immune response elicited 15-20 days after vaccination.\nThe vaccine vial contains approximately 10 doses.\nIn order to optimize the vaccine use, the randomisation was performed in blocks of 20 participants using the platform randomization.com [ http://www.jerrydallal.com/random/permute.htm ].\nThe randomization was prepared before any HW inclusion.\nThe results were printed and inserted in sealed envelopes that were numbered with BCG-001 to BCG-400.\nThe printed results as well the envelopes had the same numbers.\nAt the time of the randomisation, each participant that meets the inclusion criteria will receive a consecutive participant number [BCG-001-BCG-400].\nThe sealed envelope with the assigned number, blinded to the researchers, will be opened in front of the participant and the arm allocation will be known.\nBLINDING (MASKING) : There is no masking for the participants or for the healthcare providers.\nThe study will be blinded to the laboratory researchers and to those who will be evaluating the outcomes and performing the statistical analyses.\nIn this case, only the participant identification number will be available.\nNUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE) : Four hundred heath workers will be randomised in two groups.\nTwo hundred participants will be vaccinated, and 200 participants will not be vaccinated.\nTRIAL STATUS : The protocol approved by the Brazilian Ethical Committee is the seventh version, number CAAE: 31783720.0.0000.5078.\nThe trial has been recruiting since September 20th, 2020.\nThe clinical trial protocol was registered on August 5th, 2020.\nIt is estimated that recruitment will finish by March 2021.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : The protocol number was registered on August 5th, 2020 at REBEC (Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Cl\u00ednicos).\nRegister number: RBR-4kjqtg and WHO trial registration number UTN: U1111-1256-3892.\nFULL PROTOCOL : The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1).\nIn the interest in expediting dissemination of this material, the familiar formatting has been eliminated; this Letter serves as a summary of the key elements of the full protocol.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "health workers", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 21, "end": 35}, {"term": "HW", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 230,
