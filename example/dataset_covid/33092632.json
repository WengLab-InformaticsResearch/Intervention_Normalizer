  "abstract": "\"Early transfusion of convalescent plasma in older patients with COVID-19 to prevent disease progression: A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial\".\nThe primary objective is to demonstrate that COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) prevents progression to severe pneumonia in elderly COVID-19 pneumonia patients with chronic comorbidities.\nSecondary objectives are to demonstrate that CCP decreases the viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs and increases the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titre in recipients.\nTRIAL DESIGN : This is a randomized, open-label, parallel group, phase II/III study with a superiority framework.\nThe trial starts with a screening phase II designed with two-tailed alpha=0.2.\nIn case of positive results, the trial will proceed in a formally comparative phase III (alpha=0.05).\nAdult patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 who are at risk according to CDC definition are eligible.\nInclusion criteria are all the following: age \u2265 65; pneumonia at CT scan; PaO2/FiO2 \u2265300 mmHg; presence of one or more comorbidities; signed informed consent.\nExclusion criteria are one of the following: age < 65; PaO2/FiO2 < 300 mmHg; pending cardiopulmonary arrest; refusal to blood product transfusions; severe IgA deficiency; any life-threatening comorbidity or any other medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, makes the patient unsuitable for inclusion.\nThe trial is being conducted at three reference COVID-19 centres in the middle of Italy.\nINTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR : Intervention: COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma (CCP) in addition to standard therapy.\nPatients receive three doses (200 ml/day on 3 consecutive days) of ABO matched CCP.\nComparator: Standard therapy MAIN OUTCOMES: A. Primary outcome for Phase II: Proportion of patients without progression in severity of pulmonary disease, defined as worsening of 2 points in the ordinal scale of WHO by day 14.\nB. Primary outcome for Phase III: Proportion of patients without progression in severity of pulmonary disease, defined as worsening of 2 points in the ordinal scale of WHO by day 14.\nSecondary outcomes for Phase III: Decreased viral load on nasopharyngeal swab at days 6, 9 and 14; Decreased viremia at days 6 and 9; Increased antibody titer against SARS-CoV2 at days 30 and 60; Proportion of patients with negative of SARS-CoV2 nasopharyngeal swab at day 30; Length of hospital stay; Mortality rate at day 28; Total plasma related adverse event (day 60); Total non-plasma related adverse events (day 60); Severe adverse events (SAE) (day 60).\nTreatment allocation is randomized with a ratio 1:1 in both phase II and phase III.\nRandomization sequences will be generated at Fondazione Policlinico Gemelli IRCCS through the RedCap web application.\nRandomized stratification is performed according to age (under/over 80 years), and sex.\nBLINDING (MASKING) : None, this is an open-label trial.\nNUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE) :\nPhase II: 114 patients (57 per arm).\nPhase III: 182 patients (91 per arm) TRIAL STATUS: The trial recruitment started on May 27, 2020.\nThe anticipated date of recruitment completion is April 30, 2021.\nThe protocol version is 2 (May 10, 2020).\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : The trial has been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (May 5, 2020).\nThe Identifier number is NCT04374526 FULL PROTOCOL: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1).\nIn the interest in expediting dissemination of this material, the familiar formatting has been eliminated; this Letter serves as a summary of the key elements of the full protocol.\n",
