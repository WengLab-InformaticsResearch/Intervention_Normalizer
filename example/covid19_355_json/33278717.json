{"doc_id": "33278717", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Implementation of a cluster randomized controlled trial: Identifying student peer leaders to lead E-cigarette interventions.\nE-cigarette use has been increasing among middle school students.\nIntervention programs to prevent e-cigarette initiation administered by authority figures are met with more resistance from youth compared to peer-led programs.\nTherefore, this study aimed to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and implementation process of using social network analysis (SNA) to identify student peer leaders in schools and train them to deliver e-cigarette prevention programming to their peers.\nNine schools were recruited to participate in the study during the 2019-2020 school year.\nSchools were assigned to one of three conditions: (1) expert; (2) peer-random (selected peer-leaders would teach to random students); and (3) peer-fixed (selected peer-leaders would teach to assigned students based on nominations).\nStudy participation varied by day due to school attendance, with 686 participants at baseline and 608 at posttest.\nAlmost all students who did not complete the study resulted from the interruption of schools being closed due to COVID-19.\nImplementation issues fell into three categories: (1) scheduling, (2) day-of logistics, and (3) student group dynamics.\nOverall, the results showed positive satisfaction among teachers, who unanimously found the program appropriate for the grade-level and that peer-leaders worked well within their groups.\nPeer-led students-both random and assigned-reported having more fun and willing to tell friends to try the program compared to expert-led students.\nThis study demonstrated the feasibility of implementing a peer-led e-cigarette prevention program for 6th grade students, using SNA to provide intervention rigidity and validity.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
