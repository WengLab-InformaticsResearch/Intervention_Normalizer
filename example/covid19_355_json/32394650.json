COVID-19].\nOn the base of the idea of traditional Chinese medicine as \"disease prevention\", the mode and the protocol of the moxibustion intervention for the group under quarantine after close contact with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were explored.\nThe group under quarantine after close contact with COVID-19 was taken as the subjects.\nBy the non-contact physician-patient communication network platform co-developed by China Association of Acupuncture-Moxibustion, Hunan Provincial Association of Acupuncture-Moxibustion, Data Center of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences and Yuge Medicine Company, an exploratory randomized controlled trial was designed.\nA total of 100 cases were included and randomized into a moxibustion group and a conventional intervention group, 50 cases in each one.\nIn the moxibustion group, moxibustion intervention was used.\nIn the conventional intervention group, the conventional observation was adopted without moxibusiton intervention applied.\nThe outcomes included the symptoms changes, e.g. anxiety, emotional disturbance, fatigue, headache and diarrhea, as well as whether quarantine release and the case confirmed or not, etc.\nThe results were evaluated before intervention, in 14 days of intervention and 2 weeks after intervention separately.\nIn this research, on the base of internet plus technology and with the internet communication platform adopted, through mobile phone WeChat App, it was to implement the subject screen, the random allocation and the instruction of moxibustion intervention as well as the quality control of patient's diary and data collection.\nIt is anticipated that the significance and the implementation mode of moxibustion intervention can be assessed preliminarily for the group under quarantine after close contact with COVID-19.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "quarantine", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 82, "end": 92}, {"term": "close contact
