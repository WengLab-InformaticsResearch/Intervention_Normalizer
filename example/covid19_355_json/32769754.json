efficacy of a new remote wet lab for microsurgical education using a corneal suturing task.\nDepartment of Ophthalmology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.\nProspective randomized controlled study.\nTen ophthalmology residents were stratified by postgraduate year and randomized to perform a corneal suturing task consisting of placing the 4 cardinal sutures for a penetrating keratoplasty in porcine eyes with or without remote ophthalmology attending feedback.\nSubsequently, both groups repeated the same task without remote feedback to test whether initial remote feedback affected subsequent performance.\nFinally, the group without feedback was crossed over to repeat the same corneal suturing task with remote feedback.\nThe effectiveness of the remote wet lab was assessed subjectively by survey and objectively by grading each suture pass.\nResident-reported comfort with corneal suturing improved significantly after the remote wet lab for all residents.\nResidents and attendings rated the remote wet lab as equally or more effective compared with previous in-person wet labs and overall effective in corneal suturing.\nAttendings rated the remote wet lab as effective in multiple domains of microsurgical education using a modified microsurgical global rating scale.\nObjective corneal suturing performance was similar for both groups.\nThe remote wet lab was feasible and effective for training ophthalmology residents in corneal suturing.\nThis represents a new social distancing compliant platform for microsurgical education during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "COVID-19", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 69, "end": 77}, {"term": "microsurgical education", "negation":
