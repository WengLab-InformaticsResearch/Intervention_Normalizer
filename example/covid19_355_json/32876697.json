{"doc_id": "32876697", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Effect of Hydrocortisone on Mortality and Organ Support in Patients With Severe COVID-19: The REMAP-CAP COVID-19 Corticosteroid Domain Randomized Clinical Trial.\nImportance : Evidence regarding corticosteroid use for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is limited.\nObjective : To determine whether hydrocortisone improves outcome for patients with severe COVID-19.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants : An ongoing adaptive platform trial testing multiple interventions within multiple therapeutic domains, for example, antiviral agents, corticosteroids, or immunoglobulin.\nBetween March 9 and June 17, 2020, 614 adult patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled and randomized within at least 1 domain following admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory or cardiovascular organ support at 121 sites in 8 countries.\nOf these, 403 were randomized to open-label interventions within the corticosteroid domain.\nThe domain was halted after results from another trial were released.\nFollow-up ended August 12, 2020.\nInterventions : The corticosteroid domain randomized participants to a fixed 7-day course of intravenous hydrocortisone (50 mg or 100 mg every 6 hours) (n\u2009=\u2009143), a shock-dependent course (50 mg every 6 hours when shock was clinically evident) (n\u2009=\u2009152), or no hydrocortisone (n\u2009=\u2009108).\nMain Outcomes and Measures : The primary end point was organ support-free days (days alive and free of ICU-based respiratory or cardiovascular support) within 21 days, where patients who died were assigned -1 day.\nThe primary analysis was a bayesian cumulative logistic model that included all patients enrolled with severe COVID-19, adjusting for age, sex, site, region, time, assignment to interventions within other domains, and domain and intervention eligibility.\nSuperiority was defined as the posterior probability of an odds ratio greater than 1 (threshold for trial conclusion of superiority >99%).\nResults : After excluding 19 participants who withdrew consent, there were 384 patients (mean age, 60 years; 29% female) randomized to the fixed-dose (n\u2009=\u2009137), shock-dependent (n\u2009=\u2009146), and no (n\u2009=\u2009101) hydrocortisone groups; 379 (99%) completed the study and were included in the analysis.\nThe mean age for the 3 groups ranged between 59.5 and 60.4 years; most patients were male (range, 70.6%-71.5%); mean body mass index ranged between 29.7 and 30.9; and patients receiving mechanical ventilation ranged between 50.0% and 63.5%.\nFor the fixed-dose, shock-dependent, and no hydrocortisone groups, respectively, the median organ support-free days were 0 (IQR, -1 to 15), 0 (IQR, -1 to 13), and 0 (-1 to 11) days (composed of 30%, 26%, and 33% mortality rates and 11.5, 9.5, and 6 median organ support-free days among survivors).\nThe median adjusted odds ratio and bayesian probability of superiority were 1.43 (95% credible interval, 0.91-2.27) and 93% for fixed-dose hydrocortisone, respectively, and were 1.22 (95% credible interval, 0.76-1.94) and 80% for shock-dependent hydrocortisone compared with no hydrocortisone.\nSerious adverse events were reported in 4 (3%), 5 (3%), and 1 (1%) patients in the fixed-dose, shock-dependent, and no hydrocortisone groups, respectively.\nConclusions and Relevance : Among patients with severe COVID-19, treatment with a 7-day fixed-dose course of hydrocortisone or shock-dependent dosing of hydrocortisone, compared with no hydrocortisone, resulted in 93% and 80% probabilities of superiority with regard to the odds of improvement in organ support-free days within 21 days.\nHowever, the trial was stopped early and no treatment strategy met prespecified criteria for statistical superiority, precluding definitive conclusions.\nTrial Registration : ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
