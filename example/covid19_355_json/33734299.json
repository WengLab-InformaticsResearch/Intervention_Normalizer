{"doc_id": "33734299", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Effect of Intermediate-Dose vs Standard-Dose Prophylactic Anticoagulation on Thrombotic Events, Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Treatment, or Mortality Among Patients With COVID-19 Admitted to the Intensive Care Unit: The INSPIRATION Randomized Clinical Trial.\nImportance : Thrombotic events are commonly reported in critically ill patients with COVID-19.\nLimited data exist to guide the intensity of antithrombotic prophylaxis.\nObjective : To evaluate the effects of intermediate-dose vs standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation among patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).\nDesign, Setting, and Participants : Multicenter randomized trial with a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 factorial design performed in 10 academic centers in Iran comparing intermediate-dose vs standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation (first hypothesis) and statin therapy vs matching placebo (second hypothesis; not reported in this article) among adult patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19.\nPatients were recruited between July 29, 2020, and November 19, 2020.\nThe final follow-up date for the 30-day primary outcome was December 19, 2020.\nInterventions : Intermediate-dose (enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg daily) (n\u2009=\u2009276) vs standard prophylactic anticoagulation (enoxaparin, 40 mg daily) (n\u2009=\u2009286), with modification according to body weight and creatinine clearance.\nThe assigned treatments were planned to be continued until completion of 30-day follow-up.\nMain Outcomes and Measures : The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or mortality within 30 days, assessed in randomized patients who met the eligibility criteria and received at least 1 dose of the assigned treatment.\nPrespecified safety outcomes included major bleeding according to the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (type 3 or 5 definition), powered for noninferiority (a noninferiority margin of 1.8 based on odds ratio), and severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <20 \u00d7103/\u00b5L).\nAll outcomes were blindly adjudicated.\nResults : Among 600 randomized patients, 562 (93.7%) were included in the primary analysis (median [interquartile range] age, 62 [50-71] years; 237 [42.2%] women).\nThe primary efficacy outcome occurred in 126 patients (45.7%) in the intermediate-dose group and 126 patients (44.1%) in the standard-dose prophylaxis group (absolute risk difference, 1.5% [95% CI, -6.6% to 9.8%]; odds ratio, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.76-1.48]; P\u2009=\u2009.70).\nMajor bleeding occurred in 7 patients (2.5%) in the intermediate-dose group and 4 patients (1.4%) in the standard-dose prophylaxis group (risk difference, 1.1% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -\u221e to 3.4%]; odds ratio, 1.83 [1-sided 97.5% CI, 0.00-5.93]), not meeting the noninferiority criteria (P for noninferiority >.99).\nSevere thrombocytopenia occurred only in patients assigned to the intermediate-dose group (6 vs 0 patients; risk difference, 2.2% [95% CI, 0.4%-3.8%]; P\u2009=\u2009.01).\nConclusions and Relevance : Among patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19, intermediate-dose prophylactic anticoagulation, compared with standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation, did not result in a significant difference in the primary outcome of a composite of adjudicated venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or mortality within 30 days.\nThese results do not support the routine empirical use of intermediate-dose prophylactic anticoagulation in unselected patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19.\nTrial Registration : ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04486508.\n",
