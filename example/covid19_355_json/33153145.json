28.2 \u00b1 8.7 y) during a cycle ergometry test to exhaustion.\nArterial oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry) and tissue oxygenation index (indicator of hemoglobin saturation/desaturation) at vastus lateralis (near-infrared spectroscopy) were assessed throughout the exercise tests.\nWearing face masks had no effect on performance (time to exhaustion (mean \u00b1 SD): no mask 622 \u00b1 141 s, surgical mask 657 \u00b1 158 s, cloth mask 637 \u00b1 153 s (p = 0.20); peak power: no mask 234 \u00b1 56 W, surgical mask 241 \u00b1 57 W, cloth mask 241 \u00b1 51 W (p = 0.49)).\nWhen expressed relative to peak exercise performance, no differences were evident between wearing or not wearing a mask for arterial oxygen saturation, tissue oxygenation index, rating of perceived exertion, or heart rate at any time during the exercise tests.\nWearing a face mask during vigorous exercise had no discernable detrimental effect on blood or muscle oxygenation, and exercise performance in young, healthy participants (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04557605).\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "Healthy", "negation": "negated", "UMLS": {}, "start": 101, "end": 108}, {"term": "vigorous exercise", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 27, "end": 44}, {"term": "young", "negation": "negated", "UMLS": {}, "start": 144, "end": 149}, {"term": "healthy", "negation": "negated", "UMLS": {}, "start": 152, "end": 159}], "Comparison Results": [], "Study Arm 1 Results": [], "Study Arm 2 Results": [], "Hypothesis": []}, "Sentence-level breakdown": [{"Section": "TITLE", "Text": "Wearing of Cloth or Disposable Surgical Face Masks has no Effect on Vigorous Exercise Performance in Healthy Individuals .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "Healthy", "negation": "negated", "UMLS": {}, "start": 101, "end": 108}], "Intervention": [{"term": "Cloth or Disposable Surgical Face Masks", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 11, "end": 50}], "Outcome": [{"term": "Vigorous Exercise Performance", "negation": "negated", "UMLS": {}, "start": 68, "end": 97}], "Observation": [{"term": "Effect", "negation": "negated", "UMLS": {}, "start": 58, "end": 64}], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": [{"Intervention": "Cloth or Disposable Surgical Face Masks", "Observation": "Effect", "Outcome": "Vigorous Exercise Performance", "Count": ""}]}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "Wearing face masks is recommended for the prevention of contracting or exposing others to cardiorespiratory infections , such as COVID-19 .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "Controversy exists on whether wearing face masks during vigorous exercise affects performance .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "We used a randomized , counterbalanced cross-over design to evaluate the effects of wearing a surgical mask , a cloth mask , or no mask in 14 participants ( 7 men and 7 women ;
