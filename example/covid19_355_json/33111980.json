therapeutic resources against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a priority in clinical research considering the minimal options currently available.\nTo evaluate the adjuvant use of systemic oxygen-ozone administration in the early control of disease progression in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.\nPROBIOZOVID is an ongoing, interventional, randomized, prospective, and double-arm trial enrolling patient with COVID-19 pneumonia.\nFrom a total of 85 patients screened, 28 were recruited.\nPatients were randomly divided into ozone-autohemotherapy group (14) and control group (14).\nThe procedure consisted in a daily double-treatment with systemic Oxygen-ozone administration for 7 days.\nAll patients were treated with ad interim best available therapy.\nThe primary outcome was delta in the number of patients requiring orotracheal-intubation despite treatment.\nSecondary outcome was the difference of mortality between the two groups.\nMoreover, hematological parameters were compared before and after treatment.\nNo differences in the characteristics between groups were observed at baseline.\nAs a preliminary report we have observed that one patient for each group needed intubation and was transferred to ITU.\nNo deaths were observed at 7-14 days of follow up.\nThirty-day mortality was 8.3% for ozone group and 10% for controls.\nOzone therapy did not significantly influence inflammation markers, hematology profile, and lymphocyte subpopulations of patients treated.\nOzone therapy had an impact on the need for the ventilatory support, although did not reach statistical significance.\nFinally, no adverse events related to the use of ozone-autohemotherapy were reported.\nPreliminary results, although not showing statistically significant benefits of ozone on COVID-19, did not report any toxicity.\n\u00a9 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "COVID-19", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 46, "end":
