the COVID-19 pandemic and remote delivery for improved efficiency.\nThe LEAP-MS (Lifestyle, Exercise and Activity Package for People living with Progressive Multiple Sclerosis) study has developed an individualised supported self-management approach for physical activity for people with progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) and severe disability.\nThe intervention has been evaluated in a single-arm feasibility study with embedded process evaluation.\nThe feasibility study was due to open to recruitment during the COVID-19 2020-2021 pandemic, 1\u00a0month into the first UK-wide lockdown.\nWe worked rapidly to implement adaptions to the trial procedures and intervention delivery that we believe are applicable to randomised controlled trials.\nRecruitment became predominantly via self-referral.\nElectronic consent was employed, with consent discussions occurring over the telephone.\nRegistration, consent, eligibility assessment and data collection as well as the intervention (online physical activity tool) were via a secure, encrypted multi-user web-based platform for participants, physiotherapists and researchers accessible via various hardware.\nPhysiotherapy consultations, as well as the process evaluation, were conducted remotely using video conferencing software or the telephone.\nA remote training package for physiotherapists and site initiations was also developed and electronic site files employed.\nOur adaptions are extremely topical given the COVID-19 situation, and whilst not what we had originally planned, have enabled successful delivery of the feasibility study and are relevant to conducting randomised controlled trials and meeting the needs of people with MS who are far more isolated than ever before.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION:
