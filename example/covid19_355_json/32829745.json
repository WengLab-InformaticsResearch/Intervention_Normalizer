coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), progresses globally, and means to reduce the transmission are needed.\nIn the community, the use of face masks is increasing world-wide, but documentation for the efficacy of this remedy is lacking.\nThis trial investigates whether the use of face masks in the community will reduce wearers' risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nThis study will be a two-arm, unblinded, randomised controlled trial.\nWe will include adults (>18 years of age) without prior confirmed COVID-19 or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, who spend more than three hours per day outside the home with exposure to other people.\nA total of 6,000 participants are randomly assigned 1:1 to use face masks or not for a 30-day period during the pandemic.\nParticipants will perform self-testing; quick test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG)) (the Livzon lateral flow test) and oropharyngeal/nasal swabs for viral detection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\nThe primary endpoint following the 30-day study period is the difference in the number of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals between the two study groups as assessed by a positive nasopharyngeal swap, a positive antibody test or a hospital-based diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nWe will study whether a face mask protects the wearer of the mask against SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nThe findings are expected to apply to the present pandemic and to future viral outbreaks and to provide evidence for authority recommendations across the world.\nThis study was funded by Salling Fondene.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04337541.\nArticles published in the DMJ are
