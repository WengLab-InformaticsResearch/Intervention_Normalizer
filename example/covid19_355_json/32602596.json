{"doc_id": "32602596", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "To punish or to assist?\nDivergent reactions to ingroup and outgroup members disobeying social distancing.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, societies face the formidable challenge of developing sustainable forms of sociability-cumsocial-distancing - enduring social life while containing the virus and preventing new outbreaks.\nAccordant public policies often balance between retributive (punishment-based) and assistance (solidarity-based) measures to foster responsible behaviour.\nYet, the uncontrolled spreading of the disease has divided public opinion about which measures are best suited, and it has made salient group disparities in behaviour, potentially straining intergroup relations, elevating heated emotions, and undercutting coordinated international responses.\nIn a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 between-subjects experiment, British citizens (N\u00a0=\u00a0377) read about national in-group or outgroup members (categorical differentiation), who were either conforming to or deviating from the corona regulations (normative differentiation).\nParticipants then reported moral emotions towards the target national group and indicated support for public policies.\nIn general, support for assistance policies outweighed support for retributive measures.\nSecond, however, norm deviation was associated with less positive and more negative moral emotions, the latter category further relating to more punitiveness and less assistance support.\nFinally, respondents who read about norm-violating outgroup members especially reported support for retributive measures, indicating that people might use norm deviation to justify outgroup derogation.\nWe discuss implications for policymakers and formulate future research avenues.\n\u00a9 2020 The British Psychological Society.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "in-group or outgroup members", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 88,
