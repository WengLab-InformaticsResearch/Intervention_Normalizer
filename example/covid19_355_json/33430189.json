the study population was thus 1030 individuals.\nNon-participants did not differ from participants in key sociodemographic factors and dementia risk.\nStudy participants were M = 69.0 (SD = 4.9) years old, and 52.1% were women.\nThe average Montreal Cognitive Assessment/MoCA score was 24.5 (SD = 3.1), indicating a rather mildly cognitively impaired study population; however, 39.4% scored \u2265 26, thus being cognitively unimpaired.\nThe bandwidth of cognitive states bears the interesting potential for differential trial outcome analyses.\nHowever, trial conduction is impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring adjustments to the study protocol with yet unclear methodological consequences.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "at-risk population", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 140, "end": 158}, {"term": "General practitioners", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 0, "end": 21}], "Comparison Results": [], "Study Arm 1 Results": [], "Study Arm 2 Results": [], "Hypothesis": []}, "Sentence-level breakdown": [{"Section": "TITLE", "Text": "Recruitment and Baseline Characteristics of Participants in the AgeWell.de Study-A Pragmatic Cluster-Randomized Controlled Lifestyle Trial against Cognitive Decline .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "Targeting dementia prevention , first trials addressing multiple modifiable risk factors showed promising results in at-risk populations .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "In Germany , AgeWell.de is the first large-scale initiative investigating the effectiveness of a multi-component lifestyle intervention against cognitive decline .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [{"term": "multi-component lifestyle intervention", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 97, "end": 135}], "Outcome": [{"term": "cognitive", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 144, "end": 153}], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "We aimed to investigate the recruitment process and baseline characteristics of the AgeWell.de participants to gain an understanding of the at-risk population and who engages in the intervention .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "at-risk population", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 140, "end": 158}], "Intervention": [{"term": "AgeWell.de", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 84, "end": 94}], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "General practitioners across five study sites recruited participants ( aged 60-77 years , Cardiovascular Risk Factors , Aging , and Incidence of Dementia / CAIDE dementia risk score \u2265 9 ) .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "General practitioners", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 0, "end": 21}], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "Structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with eligible participants , including neuropsychological assessments .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [{"term": "neuropsychological", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 89, "end": 107}], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "We analyzed group differences between ( 1 ) eligible vs . non-eligible participants , ( 2 ) participants vs . non-participants , and ( 3 ) between intervention groups .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [{"term": "eligible", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 44, "end": 52}, {"term": "non-eligible", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 58, "end": 70}, {"term": "participants", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 71, "end": 83}], "Outcome": [{"term": "group differences", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 12, "end": 29}], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "Of 1176 eligible participants , 146 ( 12.5 % ) dropped out before baseline ;
