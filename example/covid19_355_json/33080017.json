{"doc_id": "33080017", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Effect of Tocilizumab vs Usual Care in Adults Hospitalized With COVID-19 and Moderate or Severe Pneumonia: A Randomized Clinical Trial.\nImportance : Severe pneumonia with hyperinflammation and elevated interleukin-6\nis a common presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nObjective : To determine whether tocilizumab (TCZ) improves outcomes of patients hospitalized with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia.\nDesign, Setting, and Particpants : This cohort-embedded, investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, bayesian randomized clinical trial investigating patients with COVID-19 and moderate or severe pneumonia requiring at least 3 L/min of oxygen but without ventilation or admission to the intensive care unit was conducted between March 31, 2020, to April 18, 2020, with follow-up through 28 days.\nPatients were recruited from 9 university hospitals in France.\nAnalyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis with no correction for multiplicity for secondary outcomes.\nInterventions : Patients were randomly assigned to receive TCZ, 8 mg/kg, intravenously plus usual care on day 1 and on day 3 if clinically indicated (TCZ group) or to receive usual care alone (UC group).\nUsual care included antibiotic agents, antiviral agents, corticosteroids, vasopressor support, and anticoagulants.\nMain Outcomes and Measures : Primary outcomes were scores higher than 5 on the World Health Organization 10-point Clinical Progression Scale (WHO-CPS) on day 4 and survival without need of ventilation (including noninvasive ventilation) at day 14.\nSecondary outcomes were clinical status assessed with the WHO-CPS scores at day 7 and day 14, overall survival, time to discharge, time to oxygen supply independency, biological factors such as C-reactive protein level, and adverse events.\nResults : Of 131 patients, 64 patients were randomly assigned to the TCZ group and 67 to UC group; 1 patient in the TCZ group withdrew consent and was not included in the analysis.\nOf the 130 patients, 42 were women (32%), and median (interquartile range) age was 64 (57.1-74.3) years.\nIn the TCZ group, 12 patients had a WHO-CPS score greater than 5 at day 4 vs 19 in the UC group (median posterior absolute risk difference [ARD] -9.0%; 90% credible interval [CrI], -21.0 to 3.1), with a posterior probability of negative ARD of 89.0% not achieving the 95% predefined efficacy threshold.\nAt day 14, 12% (95% CI -28% to 4%) fewer patients needed noninvasive ventilation (NIV) or mechanical ventilation (MV) or died in the TCZ group than in the UC group (24% vs 36%, median posterior hazard ratio [HR] 0.58; 90% CrI, 0.33-1.00), with a posterior probability of HR less than 1 of 95.0%, achieving the predefined efficacy threshold.\nThe HR for MV or death was 0.58 (90% CrI, 0.30 to 1.09).\nAt day 28, 7 patients had died in the TCZ group and 8 in the UC group (adjusted HR, 0.92; 95% CI 0.33-2.53).\nSerious adverse events occurred in 20 (32%) patients in the TCZ group and 29 (43%) in the UC group (P\u2009=\u2009.21).\nConclusions and Relevance : In this randomized clinical trial of patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia requiring oxygen support but not admitted to the intensive care unit, TCZ did not reduce WHO-CPS scores lower than 5 at day 4 but might have reduced the risk of NIV, MV, or death by day 14.\nNo difference on day 28 mortality was found.\nFurther studies are necessary for confirming these preliminary results.\nTrial Registration :
