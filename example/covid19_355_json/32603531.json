evaluate the effects of febuxostat (FBX) in comparison with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and chest CT findings in outpatients with moderate symptoms of COVID-19 infection.\nWe conducted a clinical trial involving adult outpatients with the moderate respiratory illness following COVID-19 infection.\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive either FBX or HCQ for 5 days.\nThe measured variables were needs to hospitalisation, clinical and laboratory data including fever, cough, breathing rate, C-Reactive Protein level, lymphocytes count at onset of admission and was well as at 5 days of treatments.\nIn addition, CT findings were evaluated on admission and 14 days after initiation of treatment.\nSixty subjects were enrolled in the study with a 1 to 1 ratio in FBX and HCQ groups.\nOn admission, fever (66.7%), cough (87%), tachypnoea (44.4%), dyspnoea (35%), elevated CRP value (94.4%) and lung involvement according to chest CT (100%) were documented in enrolled patients with insignificant difference between FBX and HCQ groups.\nFever, cough and tachypnoea were significantly mitigated in both groups after five days of treatments without any significant differences between groups.\nThe mean percentages of lung involvement were significantly reduced to 7.3% and 8% after 14 days of treatment with FBX and HCQ, respectively.\nIn adult outpatients with moderate COVID-19 infection, the effectiveness of FBX and HCQ was not different in terms of resolution of clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and lung CT findings.\nThis trial suggests that FBX is as an alternative treatment to HCQ for COVID-19 infection and may be considered in patients with a contraindication or precaution to HCQ.\n\u00a9 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n",
