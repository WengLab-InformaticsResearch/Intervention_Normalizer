four (18%) of them reported abstinence.\nInterviews were thematically analyzed by two coders.\nCOVID-19-induced environmental changes had mixed effects, facilitating quitting for some and impeding quitting for others.\nWhile stress increased for many, those who quit found ways to cope with stress.\nGenerally, participants felt at risk for COVID-19 complications but not at increased risk of becoming infected.\nReactions to COVID-19 and quitting behaviors differed across age groups, older participants reported difficulties coping with isolation (e.g., feeling disappointed when a text message came from the study and not a live person).\nFindings suggest that cessation interventions addressing stress and boredom are needed during COVID-19, while smokers experiencing isolation may benefit from live-person supports.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "Primary Care Patients", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 23, "end": 44}, {"term": "COVID-19", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 100, "end": 108}, {"term": "stay-at-home advisory", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 127, "end": 148}, {"term": "primary care", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 155, "end": 167}, {"term": "trying", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 186, "end": 192}, {"term": "smokers", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 36, "end": 43}, {"term": "stay-at-home advisory", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 111, "end": 132}, {"term": "COVID-19", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 94, "end": 102}, {"term": "smokers", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 111, "end": 118}, {"term": "isolation", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 132, "end": 141}], "Comparison Results": [], "Study Arm 1 Results": [], "Study Arm 2 Results": [], "Hypothesis": []}, "Sentence-level breakdown": [{"Section": "TITLE", "Text": "Quit Experiences among Primary Care Patients Enrolled in a Smoking Cessation Pilot RCT Early in the COVID-19 Pandemic .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "Primary Care Patients", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 23, "end": 44}, {"term": "COVID-19", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 100, "end": 108}], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [{"term": "Quit Experiences", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 0, "end": 16}], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on US adults ' smoking and quitting behaviors is unclear .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "We explored the impact of COVID-19 on smoking behaviors , risk perceptions , and reactions to text messages during a statewide stay-at-home advisory among primary care patients who were trying to quit .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "stay-at-home advisory", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 127, "end": 148}, {"term": "primary care", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 155, "end": 167}, {"term": "trying", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 186, "end": 192}], "Intervention": [{"term": "COVID-19", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 26, "end": 34}], "Outcome": [{"term": "smoking behaviors", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 38, "end": 55}, {"term": "risk perceptions", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 58, "end": 74}, {"term": "reactions to text messages", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 81, "end": 107}], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "From May-June 2020 , we interviewed smokers enrolled in a 12-week , pilot cessation trial providing text messaging and mailed nicotine replacement medication ( NCT04020718 ) .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "smokers", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 36, "end": 43}], "Intervention": [{"term": "text messaging", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 100, "end": 114}, {"term": "mailed nicotine replacement", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 119, "end": 146}], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "Twenty-two individuals ( 82 % white , mean age 55 years ) , representing 88 % of trial participants during the stay-at-home advisory , completed exit interviews ;
