{"doc_id": "33798303", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "[Observation of therapeutic effect on coronavirus disease 2019 with insomnia in treatment with baduanjin and auricular point sticking therapy].\nTo compare the clinical therapeutic effect on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with insomnia between the combined treatment of baduanjin and auricular point sticking therapy and the medication with oral estazolam on the base of the conventional treatment.\nA total of 90 patients with COVID-19 accompanied with insomnia were randomly divided into an observation group (45 cases, 3 cases dropped off) and a control group (45 cases).\nIn the observation group, baduanjin, a traditional Chinese fitness activity, was practiced everyday.\nBesides, auricular point sticking therapy was exerted at ear-shenmen (TF 4), subcortex (AT 4), heart (CO 15), occiput (AT 3), etc.\nThese auricular points were pressed and kneaded three times a day, 30 s at each point each time, consecutively for 12 days.\nIn the control group, estazolam tablets were prescribed for oral administration, 1 mg, once daily, consecutively for 12 days.\nBefore and after treatment, the score of Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), the score of self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), the score of self-rating depression scale (SDS) and the score of symptoms in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) were observed in the two groups and the clinical therapeutic effect was evaluated.\nAfter treatment, the scores of every item and the total scores in PSQI were all reduced as compared with those before treatment in the two groups (P<0.01).\nThe scores of sleep time and sleep efficiency in the observation group were lower than those in the control group after treatment (P<0.05).\nSAS scores and SDS scores in the observation group and SAS score in the control group after treatment were all reduced as compared with those before treatment (P<0.01), and SDS score in the observation group was lower than that in the control group (P<0.01).\nAfter treatment, in the observation group, the score of each of the symptoms of TCM, i.e. unsound sleep, irritability and hot temper, profuse sputum and sticky feeling in the mouth, bitter taste in the mouth and foul breath, abdominal distention and poor appetite, as well as lassitude was reduced as compared with that before treatment successively (P<0.01), and the scores aforementioned (excepted for the unsound sleep) in the observation group were all lower than the control group (P<0.05).\nThe total effective rates were 83.3% (35/42) in the observation group and 84.4% (38/45) in the control group, without statistical difference in comparison (P>0.05).\nThe combined treatment of baduanjin and auricular point sticking therapy improves sleep quality, the conditions of anxiety and depression and the symptoms in TCM for patients of COVID-19 with insomnia.\nThe therapeutic effect of this combined treatment is better than the oral administration of estazolam.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "insomnia", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 69, "end": 77}, {"term": "insomnia", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS":
