completed the study with known status for all outcome measures.\nIntervention or exposureOxygen hoods/helmets as compared to conventional high-flow oxygen delivery systems.\nMAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S) : 1) Pre and post change in oxygen saturation (SaO2).\n2) In-hospital Mechanical Ventilation (MV).\n3) In-hospital Mortality.\n4) Length of hospitalization.\n136 patients including 58-intervention and 78-control patients were studied.\nAge, gender, and other demographics/prognostic indicators were comparable between cohorts.\nOxygen hoods averted imminent or immediate intubation/MV in all 58 COVID-19 patients failing on conventional high-flow oxygen delivery systems with a mean improvement in SaO2 of 8.8%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001.\nMV rates were observed to be higher in the control 37/78 (47.4%) as compared to the intervention cohort 23/58 (39.7%), a difference of 7.7%, a 27% risk reduction, not statistically significant, OR 95%CI 0.73 (0.37-1.5).\nMortality rates were observed higher in the control 54/78 (69.2%) as compared to the intervention cohort 36/58 (62.1%), a difference of 7.1%, a 27% risk reduction, not statistically significant OR 95%CI 0.73 (0.36-1.5).\nOxygen hoods demonstrate improvement in SaO2 for patients failing on conventional high-flow oxygen-delivery systems and prevented imminent mechanical ventilation.\nIn-hospital mechanical ventilation and mortality rates were reduced with the use of oxygen hoods but not found to be statistically significant.\nThe oxygen hood is a safe, effective oxygen-delivery system which may reduce intubation/MV and mortality rates.\nTheir use should be considered in treating hypoxic COVID-19 patients.\nFurther research is warranted.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
