{"doc_id": "33595634", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Effect of a Single High Dose of Vitamin D3 on Hospital Length of Stay in Patients With Moderate to Severe COVID-19: A Randomized Clinical Trial.\nImportance : The efficacy of vitamin D3 supplementation in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear.\nObjective : To investigate the effect of a single high dose of vitamin D3 on hospital length of stay in patients with COVID-19.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants : This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 2 sites in Sao Paulo, Brazil.\nThe study included 240 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who were moderately to severely ill at the time of enrollment from June 2, 2020, to August 27, 2020.\nThe final follow-up was on October 7, 2020.\nInterventions : Patients were randomly assigned to receive a single oral dose of 200\u202f000 IU of vitamin D3 (n\u2009=\u2009120) or placebo (n\u2009=\u2009120).\nMain Outcomes and Measures : The primary outcome was length of stay, defined as the time from the date of randomization to hospital discharge.\nPrespecified secondary outcomes included mortality during hospitalization; the number of patients admitted to the intensive care unit; the number of patients who required mechanical ventilation and the duration of mechanical ventilation; and serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, total calcium, creatinine, and C-reactive protein.\nResults : Of 240 randomized patients, 237 were included in the primary analysis (mean [SD] age, 56.2 [14.4] years; 104 [43.9%] women; mean [SD] baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, 20.9 [9.2] ng/mL).\nMedian (interquartile range) length of stay was not significantly different between the vitamin D3 (7.0 [4.0-10.0] days) and placebo groups (7.0 [5.0-13.0] days) (log-rank P\u2009=\u2009.59; unadjusted hazard ratio for hospital discharge, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.82-1.39]; P\u2009=\u2009.62).\nThe difference between the vitamin D3 group and the placebo group was not significant for in-hospital mortality (7.6% vs 5.1%; difference, 2.5% [95% CI, -4.1% to 9.2%]; P\u2009=\u2009.43), admission to the intensive care unit (16.0% vs 21.2%; difference, -5.2% [95% CI, -15.1% to 4.7%]; P\u2009=\u2009.30), or need for mechanical ventilation (7.6% vs 14.4%; difference, -6.8% [95% CI, -15.1% to 1.2%]; P\u2009=\u2009.09).\nMean serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D significantly increased after a single dose of vitamin D3 vs placebo (44.4 ng/mL vs 19.8 ng/mL; difference, 24.1 ng/mL [95% CI, 19.5-28.7]; P\u2009<\u2009.001).\nThere were no adverse events, but an episode of vomiting was associated with the intervention.\nConclusions and Relevance : Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, a single high dose of vitamin D3, compared with placebo, did not significantly reduce hospital length of stay.\nThe findings do not support the use of a high dose of vitamin D3 for treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19.\nTrial Registration : ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04449718.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "Moderate to Severe
