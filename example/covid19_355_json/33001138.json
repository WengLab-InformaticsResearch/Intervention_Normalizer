{"doc_id": "33001138", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Efficacy and Safety of Hydroxychloroquine vs Placebo for Pre-exposure SARS-CoV-2 Prophylaxis Among Health Care Workers: A Randomized Clinical Trial.\nImportance : Health care workers (HCWs) caring for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are at risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\nCurrently, to our knowledge, there is no effective pharmacologic prophylaxis for individuals at risk.\nObjective : To evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital-based HCWs with exposure to patients with COVID-19 using a pre-exposure prophylaxis strategy.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants : This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (the Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19 With Hydroxychloroquine Study) was conducted at 2 tertiary urban hospitals, with enrollment from April 9, 2020, to July 14, 2020; follow-up ended August 4, 2020.\nThe trial randomized 132 full-time, hospital-based HCWs (physicians, nurses, certified nursing assistants, emergency technicians, and respiratory therapists), of whom 125 were initially asymptomatic and had negative results for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab.\nThe trial was terminated early for futility before reaching a planned enrollment of 200 participants.\nInterventions : Hydroxychloroquine, 600 mg, daily, or size-matched placebo taken orally for 8 weeks.\nMain Outcomes and Measures : The primary outcome was the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by a nasopharyngeal swab during the 8 weeks of treatment.\nSecondary outcomes included adverse effects, treatment discontinuation, presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, frequency of QTc prolongation, and clinical outcomes for SARS-CoV-2-positive participants.\nResults : Of the 132 randomized participants (median age, 33 years [range, 20-66 years]; 91 women [69%]), 125 (94.7%) were evaluable for the primary outcome.\nThere was no significant difference in infection rates in participants randomized to receive hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo (4 of 64 [6.3%] vs 4 of 61 [6.6%]; P\u2009>\u2009.99).\nMild adverse events were more common in participants taking hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo (45% vs 26%; P\u2009=\u2009.04); rates of treatment discontinuation were similar in both arms (19% vs 16%; P\u2009=\u2009.81).\nThe median change in QTc (baseline to 4-week evaluation) did not differ between arms (hydroxychloroquine: 4 milliseconds; 95% CI, -9 to 17; vs placebo: 3 milliseconds; 95% CI, -5 to 11; P\u2009=\u2009.98).\nOf the 8 participants with positive results for SARS-CoV-2 (6.4%), 6 developed viral symptoms; none required hospitalization, and all clinically recovered.\nConclusions and Relevance : In this randomized clinical trial, although limited by early termination, there was no clinical benefit of hydroxychloroquine administered daily for 8 weeks as pre-exposure prophylaxis in hospital-based HCWs exposed to patients with COVID-19.\nTrial Registration : ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04329923.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "Pre-exposure SARS-CoV-2 Prophylaxis", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 57, "end": 92}, {"term": "Health Care Workers", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 99, "end": 118}, {"term": "hospital-based HCWs", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 100, "end": 119}, {"term": "exposure to patients with COVID-19", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 125, "end": 159}, {"term": "full-time , hospital-based HCWs", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 25, "end": 56}, {"term": "hospital-based HCWs", "negation": "negated", "UMLS": {}, "start": 218, "end": 237}], "Comparison Results": [], "Study Arm 1 Results": [], "Study Arm 2 Results": [], "Hypothesis": []}, "Sentence-level breakdown": [{"Section": "TITLE", "Text": "Efficacy and Safety of Hydroxychloroquine vs Placebo for Pre-exposure SARS-CoV-2 Prophylaxis Among Health Care Workers : A Randomized Clinical Trial .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "Pre-exposure SARS-CoV-2 Prophylaxis", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 57, "end": 92}, {"term": "Health Care Workers", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 99, "end": 118}], "Intervention": [{"term": "Hydroxychloroquine", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 23, "end": 41}, {"term": "Placebo", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 45, "end": 52}], "Outcome": [{"term": "Safety", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 13, "end": 19}], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "Importance : Health care workers ( HCWs ) caring for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) are at risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "Currently , to our knowledge , there is no effective pharmacologic prophylaxis for individuals at risk .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "Objective : To evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital-based HCWs with exposure to patients with COVID-19 using a pre-exposure prophylaxis strategy .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "hospital-based HCWs", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 100, "end": 119}, {"term": "exposure to patients with COVID-19", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 125, "end": 159}], "Intervention": [{"term": "hydroxychloroquine", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 40, "end": 58}], "Outcome": [{"term": "transmission of SARS-CoV-2", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 70, "end": 96}], "Observation": [{"term": "prevent", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 62, "end": 69}], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "Design , Setting , and Participants : This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial ( the Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19 With Hydroxychloroquine Study ) was conducted at 2 tertiary urban hospitals , with enrollment from April 9 , 2020 , to July 14 , 2020 ;
