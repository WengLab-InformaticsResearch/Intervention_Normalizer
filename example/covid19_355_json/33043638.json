Love Intervention.\nA second pandemic of mental health problems due to COVID-19 is predicted, suggesting a demand for interventions to mitigate its impacts.\nThis study evaluated the effectiveness of an online psychological intervention based on the Awareness, Courage, and Love (ACL) model from Functional Analytic Psychotherapy to promote closeness between couples during the pandemic.\nThirty-one couples were randomised into either the intervention or control group for a 2-hour online group session.\nThe intervention was designed to increase closeness between couples, whereas control group members watched a movie.\nIn both groups, participants responded to two instruments that assessed the couple's relationship.\nGeneralised linear mixed modeling was used to compare the change scores over time between the groups, with random effects used to control for the correlation within a couple and the correlation within the individual.\nThe intervention group's closeness increased by 23 per cent while the control group's closeness increased only 2 per cent.\nA week later, a significant difference between the two groups emerged on closeness.\nOnline ACL protocols requiring minimal training offer a promising intervention to quickly buffer against stress for large numbers of individuals during pandemic times.\n\u00a9 2020 International Association of Applied Psychology.\n",
