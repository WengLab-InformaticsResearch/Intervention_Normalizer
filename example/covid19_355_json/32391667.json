of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of patients with moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nWe prospectively enrolled 30 treatment-na\u00efve patients with confirmed COVID-19 after informed consent at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center.\nThe patients were randomized 1\uff1a1 to HCQ group and the control group.\nPatients in HCQ group were given HCQ 400 mg per day for 5 days plus conventional treatments, while those in the control group were given conventional treatment only.\nThe primary endpoint was negative conversion rate of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in respiratory pharyngeal swab on days 7 after randomization.\nThis study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and registered online (NCT04261517).\nOne patient in HCQ group developed to severe during the treatment.\nOn day 7, nucleic acid of throat swabs was negative in 13 (86.7%) cases in the HCQ group and 14 (93.3%) cases in the control group (P>0.05).\nThe median duration from hospitalization to virus nucleic acid negative conservation was 4 (1,9) days in HCQ group, which is comparable to that in the control group [2 (1,4) days, Z=1.27, P>0.05].\nThe median time for body temperature normalization in HCQ group was 1 (0,2) day after hospitalization, which was also comparable to that in the control group [1 (0,3) day].\nRadiological progression was shown on CT images in 5 cases (33.3%) of the HCQ group and 7 cases (46.7%) of the control group, and all patients showed improvement in follow-up examinations.\nFour cases (26.7%) of the HCQ group and 3 cases (20%) of the control group had transient diarrhea and abnormal liver function (P>0.05).\nThe prognosis of COVID-19 moderate patients is good.\nLarger sample size study are needed to investigate the effects of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19.\nSubsequent research should determine better endpoint and fully consider the feasibility of experiments such as sample size.\n", "Evidence
