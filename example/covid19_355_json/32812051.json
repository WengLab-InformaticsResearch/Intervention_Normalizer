{"doc_id": "32812051", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "The impact of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir or ribavirin in patients with severe COVID-19.\nSofosbuvir and daclatasvir are direct-acting antivirals highly effective against hepatitis C virus.\nThere is some in silico and in vitro evidence that suggests these agents may also be effective against SARS-CoV-2.\nThis trial evaluated the effectiveness of sofosbuvir in combination with daclatasvir in treating patients with COVID-19.\nPatients with a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR or bilateral multi-lobar ground-glass opacity on their chest CT and signs of severe COVID-19 were included.\nSubjects were divided into two arms with one arm receiving ribavirin and the other receiving sofosbuvir/daclatasvir.\nAll participants also received the recommended national standard treatment which, at that time, was lopinavir/ritonavir and single-dose hydroxychloroquine.\nThe primary endpoint was time from starting the medication until discharge from hospital with secondary endpoints of duration of ICU stay and mortality.\nSixty-two subjects met the inclusion criteria, with 35 enrolled in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir arm and 27 in the ribavirin arm.\nThe median duration of stay was 5\u2009days for the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir group and 9\u2009days for the ribavirin group.\nThe mortality in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir group was 2/35 (6%) and 9/27 (33%) for the ribavirin group.\nThe relative risk of death for patients treated with sofosbuvir/daclatasvir was 0.17 (95% CI 0.04-0.73, P\u2009=\u20090.02) and the number needed to treat for benefit was 3.6 (95% CI 2.1-12.1, P\u2009<\u20090.01).\nGiven these encouraging initial results, and the current lack of treatments proven to decrease mortality in COVID-19, further investigation in larger-scale trials seems warranted.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.\nPublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British
