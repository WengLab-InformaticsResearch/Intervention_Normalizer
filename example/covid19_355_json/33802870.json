Trial.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, many primary care professionals were overburdened and experienced difficulties reaching vulnerable patients and meeting the increased need for psychosocial support.\nThis randomized controlled trial (RCT) tested whether a primary healthcare (PHC) based community health worker (CHW) intervention could tackle psychosocial suffering due to physical distancing measures in patients with limited social networks.\nCHWs provided 8 weeks of tailored psychosocial support to the intervention group.\nControl group patients received 'care as usual'.\nThe impact on feelings of emotional support, social isolation, social participation, anxiety and fear of COVID-19 were measured longitudinally using a face-to-face survey to determine their mean change from baseline.\nSelf-rated change in psychosocial health at 8 weeks was determined.\nWe failed to find a significant effect of the intervention on the prespecified psychosocial health measures.\nHowever, the intervention did lead to significant improvement in self-rated change in psychosocial health.\nThis study confirms partially the existing evidence on the effectiveness of CHW interventions as a strategy to address mental health in PHC in a COVID context.\nFurther research is needed to elaborate the implementation of CHWs in PHC to reach vulnerable populations during and after health crises.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "Community", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 0, "end": 9}, {"term": "CHWs", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start":
