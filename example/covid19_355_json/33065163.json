BMI\u202f\u2265\u202f27\u202fkg/m2) were analyzed before and after a standardized 12-week dietary weight reduction program.\nAfterwards subjects were randomized to a 12-month lifestyle intervention or a control group (Maintain-Adults trial).\nInsulin sensitivity (IS) was estimated by HOMA-IR (as an estimate of liver IS) and ISIClamp (as an estimate of skeletal muscle IS).\nACE-2 mRNA expression (ACE-2AT) was measured in subcutaneous adipose tissue before and after weight loss.\nACE-2AT was not affected by obesity, but was reduced in insulin resistant subjects.\nWeight loss resulted in a decline of ACE-2AT (29.0 (20.0-47.9) vs. 21.0 (13.0-31.0); p\u202f=\u202f1.6\u202f\u2217\u202f10-7).\nA smaller reduction of ACE-2 AT (\u0394ACE-2AT) was associated with a larger improvement of ISIClamp (p\u202f=\u202f0.013) during weight reduction over 3\u202fmonths, but not with the extend of weight loss.\nThe degree of changes in insulin resistance were preserved until month 12 and was also predicted by the weight loss induced degree of \u0394ACE-2AT (p\u202f=\u202f0.011).\nOur data indicate that subcutaneous adipose ACE-2 expression correlates with insulin sensitivity.\nWeight loss induced decline of subcutaneous adipose ACE-2 expression might affect short- and long-term improvement of myocellular insulin sensitivity, which might be also relevant in the context of ACE-2 downregulation by SARS-CoV-2.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT00850629, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00850629, date of registration: February 25, 2009.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020.\nPublished by Elsevier Inc.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "COVID-19 infections", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 92, "end": 111}, {"term": "weight loss", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 95, "end": 106}, {"term": "obesity", "negation": "negated", "UMLS": {}, "start": 28, "end": 35}, {"term": "insulin resistant", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 57, "end": 74}], "Comparison Results": [], "Study Arm 1 Results": [], "Study Arm 2 Results": [], "Hypothesis": []}, "Sentence-level breakdown": [{"Section": "TITLE", "Text": "Metabolic impact of weight loss induced reduction of adipose ACE-2-Potential implication in COVID-19 infections ?", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "COVID-19 infections", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 92, "end": 111}], "Intervention": [{"term": "Metabolic impact", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 0, "end": 16}, {"term": "weight loss", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 20, "end": 31}], "Outcome": [{"term": "adipose ACE-2-Potential implication", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 53, "end": 88}], "Observation": [{"term": "reduction", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 40, "end": 49}], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": [{"Intervention": "Metabolic impact", "Observation": "reduction", "Outcome": "adipose ACE-2-Potential implication", "Count": ""}, {"Intervention": "weight loss", "Observation": "reduction", "Outcome": "adipose ACE-2-Potential implication", "Count": ""}]}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "BACKGROUND & AIMS : Angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) -2 is a modulator of adipose tissue metabolism .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "However , human data of adipose ACE-2 is rarely available .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "Considering that , ACE-2 is believed to be the receptor responsible for cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 , a better understanding of its regulation is desirable .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "We therefore characterized the modulation of subcutaneous adipose ACE-2 mRNA expression during weight loss and the impact of ACE-2 expression on weight loss induced short- and long-term improvements of glucose metabolism .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "weight loss", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 95, "end": 106}], "Intervention": [{"term": "ACE-2 expression", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 125, "end": 141}], "Outcome": [{"term": "modulation of subcutaneous adipose ACE-2 mRNA expression", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 31, "end": 87}, {"term": "weight loss", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 95, "end": 106}, {"term": "glucose metabolism", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 202, "end": 220}], "Observation": [{"term": "short- and long-term improvements", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 165, "end": 198}], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": [{"Intervention": "ACE-2 expression", "Observation": "short- and long-term improvements", "Outcome": "weight loss", "Count": ""}, {"Intervention": "ACE-2 expression", "Observation": "short- and long-term improvements", "Outcome": "glucose metabolism", "Count": ""}]}, {"Section": "METHODS", "Text": "143 subjects ( age > 18 ;
