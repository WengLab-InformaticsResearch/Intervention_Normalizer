{"doc_id": "33545094", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Safety and efficacy of an rAd26 and rAd5 vector-based heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine: an interim analysis of a randomised controlled phase 3 trial in Russia.\nA heterologous recombinant adenovirus (rAd)-based vaccine, Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V), showed a good safety profile and induced strong humoral and cellular immune responses in participants in phase 1/2 clinical trials.\nHere, we report preliminary results on the efficacy and safety of Gam-COVID-Vac from the interim analysis of this phase 3 trial.\nWe did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at 25 hospitals and polyclinics in Moscow, Russia.\nWe included participants aged at least 18 years, with negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR and IgG and IgM tests, no infectious diseases in the 14 days before enrolment, and no other vaccinations in the 30 days before enrolment.\nParticipants were randomly assigned (3:1) to receive vaccine or placebo, with stratification by age group.\nInvestigators, participants, and all study staff were masked to group assignment.\nThe vaccine was administered (0\u00b75 mL/dose) intramuscularly in a prime-boost regimen: a 21-day interval between the first dose (rAd26) and the second dose (rAd5), both vectors carrying the gene for the full-length SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein S. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 from day 21 after receiving the first dose.\nAll analyses excluded participants with protocol violations: the primary outcome was assessed in participants who had received two doses of vaccine or placebo, serious adverse events were assessed in all participants who had received at least one dose at the time of database lock, and rare adverse events were assessed in all participants who had received two doses and for whom all available data were verified in the case report form at the time of database lock.\nThe trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04530396).\nBetween Sept 7 and Nov 24, 2020, 21\u2008977 adults were randomly assigned to the vaccine group (n=16\u2008501) or the placebo group (n=5476).\n19\u2008866 received two doses of vaccine or placebo and were included in the primary outcome analysis.\nFrom 21 days after the first dose of vaccine (the day of dose 2), 16 (0\u00b71%) of 14\u2008964 participants in the vaccine group and 62 (1\u00b73%) of 4902 in the placebo group were confirmed to have COVID-19; vaccine efficacy was 91\u00b76% (95% CI 85\u00b76-95\u00b72).\nMost reported adverse events were grade 1 (7485 [94\u00b70%] of 7966 total events).\n45 (0\u00b73%) of 16\u2008427 participants in the vaccine group and 23 (0\u00b74%) of 5435 participants in the placebo group had serious adverse events; none were considered associated with vaccination, with confirmation from the independent data monitoring committee.\nFour deaths were reported during the study (three [<0\u00b71%] of 16 427 participants in the vaccine group and one [<0\u00b71%] of 5435 participants in the placebo group), none of which were considered related to the vaccine.\nThis interim analysis of the phase 3 trial of Gam-COVID-Vac showed 91\u00b76% efficacy against COVID-19 and was well tolerated in a large cohort.\nMoscow City Health Department, Russian Direct Investment Fund, and Sberbank.\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
