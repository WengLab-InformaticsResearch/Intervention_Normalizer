{"doc_id": "33045402", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "The vitamin D for COVID-19 (VIVID) trial: A pragmatic cluster-randomized design.\nTo determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on disease progression and post-exposure prophylaxis for COVID-19 infection.\nWe hypothesize that high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation will reduce risk of hospitalization/death among those with recently diagnosed COVID-19 infection and will reduce risk of COVID-19 infection among their close household contacts.\nWe report the rationale and design of a planned pragmatic, cluster randomized, double-blinded trial (N\u00a0=\u00a02700 in total nationwide), with 1500 newly diagnosed individuals with COVID-19 infection, together with up to one close household contact each (~1200 contacts), randomized to either vitamin D3 (loading dose, then 3200\u00a0IU/day) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio and a household cluster design.\nThe study duration is 4\u00a0weeks.\nThe primary outcome for newly diagnosed individuals is the occurrence of hospitalization and/or mortality.\nKey secondary outcomes include symptom severity scores among cases and changes in the infection (seroconversion) status for their close household contacts.\nChanges in vitamin D 25(OH)D levels will be assessed and their relation to study outcomes will be explored.\nThe proposed pragmatic trial will allow parallel testing of vitamin D3 supplementation for early treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19.\nThe household cluster design provides a cost-efficient approach to testing an intervention for reducing rates of hospitalization and/or mortality in newly diagnosed cases and preventing infection among their close household contacts.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020.\nPublished by
