{"doc_id": "33119538", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Threat, Coping, and Social Distance Adherence During COVID-19: Cross-Continental Comparison Using an Online Cross-Sectional Survey.\nSocial distancing is an effective preventative policy for COVID-19 that is enforced by governments worldwide.\nHowever, significant variations are observed in adherence to social distancing across individuals and countries.\nDue to the lack of treatment, rapid spread, and prevalence of COVID-19, panic and fear associated with the disease causes great stress.\nSubsequent effects will be a variation around the coping and mitigation strategies for different individuals following different paths to manage the situation.\nThis study aims to explore how threat and coping appraisal processes work as mechanisms between information and citizens' adherence to COVID-19-related recommendations (ie, how the information sources and social media influence threat and coping appraisal processes with COVID-19 and how the threat and coping appraisal processes influence adherence to policy guidelines).\nIn addition, this study aims to explore how citizens in three different countries (the United States, Kuwait, and South Korea), randomly sampled, are effectively using the mechanisms.\nRandomly sampled online survey data collected by a global firm in May 2020 from 162 citizens of the United States, 185 of Kuwait, and 71 of South Korea were analyzed, resulting in a total sample size of 418.\nA seemingly unrelated regression model, controlling for several counterfactuals, was used for analysis.\nThe study's focal estimated effects were compared across the three countries using the weighted distance between the parameter estimates.\nThe seemingly unrelated regression model estimation results suggested that, overall, the intensity of information source use for the COVID-19 pandemic positively influenced the threat appraisal for the disease (P<.001).\nFurthermore, the intensity of social media use for the COVID-19 pandemic positively influenced the coping appraisal for the disease (P<.001).\nHigher COVID-19 threat appraisal had a positive effect on social distancing adherence (P<.001).\nHigher COVID-19 coping appraisal had a positive effect on social distancing adherence (P<.001).\nHigher intensity of COVID-19 knowledge positively influenced social distancing adherence (P<.001).\nThere were country-level variations.\nBroadly, we found that the United States had better results than South Korea and Kuwait in leveraging the information to threat and coping appraisal to the adherence process, indicating that individuals in countries like the United States and South Korea may be more pragmatic to appraise the situation before making any decisions.\nThis study's findings suggest that the mediation of threat and coping strategies are essential, in varying effects, to shape the information and social media strategies for adherence outcomes.\nAccordingly, coordinating public service announcements along with information source outlets such as mainstream media (eg, TV and newspaper) as well as social media (eg, Facebook and Twitter) to inform citizens and, at the same time, deliver balanced messages about the threat and coping appraisal is critical in implementing a staggered social distancing and sheltering strategy.\n\u00a9Abrar Al-Hasan, Jiban Khuntia, Dobin Yim.\nOriginally published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research (http://www.jmir.org), 18.11.2020.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment":
