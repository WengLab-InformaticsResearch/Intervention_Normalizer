COVID-19: The TOGETHER Randomized Clinical Trial.\nImportance : Data on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir for the treatment of high-risk outpatients with COVID-19 in developing countries are needed.\nObjective : To determine whether hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir reduces hospitalization among high-risk patients with early symptomatic COVID-19 in an outpatient setting.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants : This randomized clinical trial was conducted in Brazil.\nRecently symptomatic adults diagnosed with respiratory symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled between June 2 and September 30, 2020.\nThe planned sample size was 1476 patients, with interim analyses planned after 500 patients were enrolled.\nThe trial was stopped after the interim analysis for futility with a sample size of 685 patients.\nStatistical analysis was performed in December 2020.\nInterventions : Patients were randomly assigned to hydroxychloroquine (800 mg loading dose, then 400 mg daily for 9 days), lopinavir-ritonavir (loading dose of 800 mg and 200 mg, respectively, every 12 hours followed by 400 mg and 100 mg, respectively, every 12 hours for the next 9 days), or placebo.\nMain Outcomes and Measures : The primary outcomes were COVID-19-associated hospitalization and death assessed at 90 days after randomization.\nCOVID-19-associated hospitalization was analyzed with a Cox proportional hazards model.\nThe trial included the following secondary outcomes: all-cause hospitalization, viral clearance, symptom resolution, and adverse events.\nResults : Of 685 participants, 632 (92.3%) self-identified as mixed-race, 377 (55.0%) were women, and the median (range) age was 53 (18-94) years.\nA total of 214 participants were randomized to hydroxychloroquine; 244, lopinavir-ritonavir; and 227, placebo.\nAt first interim analysis, the data safety monitoring board recommended stopping enrollment of both hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir-ritonavir groups because of futility.\nThe proportion of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 was 3.7% (8 participants) in the hydroxychloroquine group, 5.7% (14 participants) in the lopinavir-ritonavir group, and 4.8% (11 participants) in the placebo group.\nWe found no significant differences between interventions for COVID-19-associated hospitalization (hydroxychloroquine: hazard ratio [HR], 0.76 [95% CI, 0.30-1.88]; lopinavir-ritonavir: HR, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.53-2.56] as well as for the secondary outcome of viral clearance through day 14 (hydroxychloroquine: odds ratio [OR], 0.91 [95% CI, 0.82-1.02]; lopinavir-ritonavir: OR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.94-1.16]).\nAt the end of the trial, there were 3 fatalities recorded, 1 in the placebo group and 2 in the lopinavir-ritonavir intervention group.\nConclusions and Relevance : In this randomized clinical trial, neither hydroxychloroquine nor lopinavir-ritonavir showed any significant benefit for decreasing COVID-19-associated hospitalization or other secondary clinical outcomes.\nThis trial suggests that expedient clinical trials can be implemented in low-income settings even during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTrial
