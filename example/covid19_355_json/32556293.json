Patients.\nOur aim in this study was to identify a prognostic biomarker to predict the disease prognosis and reduce the mortality rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has caused a worldwide pandemic.\nCOVID-19 patients were randomly divided into training and test groups.\nUnivariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify the disease prognosis signature, which was selected to establish a risk model in the training group.\nThe disease prognosis signature of COVID-19 was validated in the test group.\nThe signature of COVID-19 was combined with the following 5 indicators: neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, procalcitonin, age, and C-reactive protein.\nThe signature stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups with significantly relevant disease prognosis (log-rank test, P < .001) in the training group.\nThe survival analysis indicated that the high-risk group displayed substantially lower survival probability than the low-risk group (log-rank test, P < .001).\nThe area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that the signature of COVID-19 displayed the highest predictive accuracy regarding disease prognosis, which was 0.955 in the training group and 0.945 in the test group.\nThe ROC analysis of both groups demonstrated that the predictive ability of the signature surpassed the use of each of the 5 indicators alone.\nThe signature of COVID-19 presents a novel predictor and prognostic biomarker for closely monitoring patients and providing timely treatment for those who are severely or critically ill.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.\nPublished by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\nAll rights reserved.\nFor permissions, e-mail:
