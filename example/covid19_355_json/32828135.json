{"doc_id": "32828135", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Hydroxychloroquine in the Treatment of COVID-19: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Study.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is showing an exponential growth, mandating an urgent need to develop an effective treatment.\nIndeed, to date, a well-established therapy is still lacking.\nWe aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) added to standard care in patients with COVID-19.\nThis was a multicenter, randomized controlled trial conducted at three major university hospitals in Egypt.\nOne hundred ninety-four patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were included in the study after signing informed consent.\nThey were equally randomized into two arms: 97 patients administrated HCQ plus standard care (HCQ group) and 97 patients administered only standard care as a control arm (control group).\nThe primary endpoints were recovery within 28 days, need for mechanical ventilation, or death.\nThe two groups were matched for age and gender.\nThere was no significant difference between them regarding any of the baseline characteristics or laboratory parameters.\nFour patients (4.1%) in the HCQ group and 5 (5.2%) patients in the control group needed mechanical ventilation (P = 0.75).\nThe overall mortality did not differ between the two groups, as six patients (6.2%) died in the HCQ group and 5 (5.2%) died in the control group (P = 0.77).\nUnivariate logistic regression analysis showed that HCQ treatment was not significantly associated with decreased mortality in COVID-19 patients.\nSo, adding HCQ to standard care did not add significant benefit, did not decrease the need for ventilation, and did not reduce mortality rates in COVID-19 patients.\n", "Evidence Map":
