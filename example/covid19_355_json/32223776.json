{"doc_id": "32223776", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "A Randomized Trial of Instructor-Led Training Versus Video Lesson in Training Health Care Providers in Proper Donning and Doffing of Personal Protective Equipment.\nThis study compared live instructor-led training with video-based instruction in personal protective equipment (PPE) donning and doffing.\nIt assessed the difference in performance between (1) attending 1 instructor-led training session in donning and doffing PPE at 1 month prior to assessment, and (2) watching training videos for 1 month.\nThis randomized controlled trial pilot study divided 21 medical students and junior doctors into 2 groups.\nControl group participants attended 1 instructor-led training session.\nVideo group participants watched training videos demonstrating the same procedures, which they could freely watch again at home.\nAfter 1 month, a doctor performed a blind evaluation of performance using checklists.\nNineteen participants were assessed after 1 month.\nThe mean donning score was 84.8/100 for the instructor-led group and 88/100 for the video group; mean effect size was 3.2 (95% CI: -7.5 to 9.5).\nThe mean doffing score was 79.1/100 for the instructor-led group and 73.9/100 for the video group; mean effect size was 5.2 (95% CI: -7.6 to 18).\nOur study found no significant difference in donning and doffing scores between instructor-led and video lessons.\nVideo training could be a fast and resource-efficient method of training in PPE donning and doffing in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "Health Care Providers", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 78, "end": 99}, {"term": "medical students", "negation": "affirmed",
