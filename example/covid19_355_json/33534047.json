p\u202f=\u20090.25).\nIn the PP analysis, patients on MP had a\u00a0significantly lower risk of experiencing the composite endpoint (age-adjusted risk ratio 0.42; 95% confidence interval, CI 0.20-0.89; p\u202f=\u20090.043).\nThe planned sample size was not achieved, and our results should therefore be interpreted with caution.\nThe use of MP had no significant effect on the primary endpoint in ITT analysis; however, the PP analysis showed a\u00a0beneficial effect due to MP, which consistent with other published trials support the use of glucocorticoids in severe cases of COVID-19.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "adults", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 22, "end": 28}, {"term": "hospitalized", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 29, "end": 41}, {"term": "COVID-19 pneumonia", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 47, "end": 65}, {"term": "severe SARS-CoV\u20112", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 99, "end": 116}, {"term": "COVID-19", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 49, "end": 57}, {"term": "oxygen without mechanical ventilation", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 104, "end": 141}, {"term": "systemic inflammatory response", "negation": "negated", "UMLS": {}, "start": 165, "end": 195}, {"term": "severe", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 230, "end": 236}], "Comparison Results": [], "Study Arm 1 Results": [], "Study Arm 2 Results": [], "Hypothesis": []}, "Sentence-level breakdown": [{"Section": "TITLE", "Text": "Methylprednisolone in adults hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia An open-label randomized trial ( GLUCOCOVID ) .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "adults", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 22, "end": 28}, {"term": "hospitalized", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 29, "end": 41}, {"term": "COVID-19 pneumonia", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 47, "end": 65}], "Intervention": [{"term": "Methylprednisolone", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 0, "end": 18}], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "PURPOSE", "Text": "To determine whether a 6-day course of methylprednisolone ( MP ) improves outcome in patients with severe SARS-CoV\u20112 ( Corona Virus Disease 2019 [ COVID-19 ] ) .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "severe SARS-CoV\u20112", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 99, "end": 116}], "Intervention": [{"term": "methylprednisolone ( MP )", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 39, "end": 64}], "Outcome": [{"term": "outcome", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 74, "end": 81}], "Observation": [{"term": "improves", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 65, "end": 73}], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "METHODS", "Text": "The study was a multicentric open-label trial of COVID-19 patients who were aged \u2265 18 years , receiving oxygen without mechanical ventilation , and with evidence of systemic inflammatory response who were assigned to standard of care ( SOC ) or SOC plus intravenous MP ( 40 mg bid for 3 days followed by 20 mg bid for 3 days ) .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "COVID-19", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 49, "end": 57}, {"term": "oxygen without mechanical ventilation", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 104, "end": 141}, {"term": "systemic inflammatory response", "negation": "negated", "UMLS": {}, "start": 165, "end": 195}], "Intervention": [{"term": "standard of care ( SOC )", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 217, "end": 241}, {"term": "SOC plus intravenous MP", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 245, "end": 268}], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "METHODS", "Text": "The primary outcome was a composite of death , admission to the intensive care unit , or requirement for noninvasive ventilation .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [{"term": "composite of death", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 26, "end": 44}, {"term": "admission to the intensive care unit", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 47, "end": 83}, {"term": "requirement for", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 89, "end": 104}], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "METHODS", "Text": "Both intention-to-treat ( ITT ) and per protocol ( PP ) analyses were performed .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "RESULTS", "Text": "A total of 91 patients were screened , and 64 were randomized ( mean age ##70 \u00b1 12 years ) .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "RESULTS", "Text": "In the ITT analysis , 14 of 29 patients ( 48 % ) in the SOC group and 14 of 35 ( 40 % ) in the MP group suffered the composite endpoint ( 40 % versus 20 % in patients under 72 years and 67 % versus 48 % in those over 72 years ;
