{"doc_id": "33705475", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Providing open-label placebos remotely-A randomized controlled trial in allergic rhinitis.\nPlacebos can reduce physical symptoms even when provided with full honesty and disclosure.\nYet, the precise mechanisms underlying the effects of \"open-label placebos\" (OLPs) have remained subject of debate.\nFurthermore, it is unclear whether OLPs are similarly effective when provided remotely, as is sometimes required e.g. in the current COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn a randomized-controlled trial, we examined the effects of OLP plus treatment as usual (TAU) compared to TAU alone on symptom reduction in people with allergic rhinitis (N = 54) over the course of two weeks.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, OLP was provided remotely (i.e. sent via postal service).\nTo investigate the potential influence of the clinical encounter on the effects of OLP, we manipulated the perception of the virtual clinical encounter, both with respect to verbal and nonverbal factors (augmented vs. limited encounter).\nThe results of the manipulation check confirmed that the augmented clinical encounter was evaluated more positively than the limited encounter, in terms of perceived warmth of the provider.\nParticipants from all treatment groups showed significant symptom reduction from baseline to two weeks later, but OLP had no incremental effect over TAU.\nParticipants benefitted more from OLP when they did not take any other medication against allergic symptoms than when taking medication on demand.\nWhen controlling for baseline symptoms, a significant treatment by encounter interaction was found, pointing to greater symptom improvement in the OLP group when the encounter was augmented, whereas the control group improved more when the encounter was limited.\nThe study demonstrates that providing OLP and enhancing the encounter remotely is possible, but their effectiveness might be lower in comparison to previous studies relying on physical patient-provider interaction.\nThe study raises questions for future research about the potential and challenges of remote placebo studies and virtual clinical encounters.\nThe study has been registered as a clinical trial at ISRCTN (record number: 39018).\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "allergic rhinitis", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {},
