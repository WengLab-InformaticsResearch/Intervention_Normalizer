{"doc_id": "33761870", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Efficacy and safety of Levamisole treatment in clinical presentations of non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19: a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial.\nLevamisole has shown clinical benefits in the management of COVID-19 via its immunomodulatory effect.\nHowever, the exact role of Levamisole effect in clinical status of COVID-19 patients is unknown.\nWe aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Levamisole on clinical status of patients with COVID-19 during their course of the disease.\nThis prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial was performed in adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 (room-air oxygen saturation\u2009>\u200994%) from late April 2020 to mid-August 2020.\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive a 3-day course of Levamisole or placebo in combination with routine standard of care.\nWith 25 patients in each arm, 50 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in the study.\nMost of the study participants were men (60%).\nOn days 3 and 14, patients in Levamisole group had significantly better cough status distribution when compared to the placebo group (P-value\u2009=\u20090.034 and 0.005, respectively).\nMoreover, there was significant differences between the two groups in dyspnea at follow-up intervals of 7 (P-value\u2009=\u20090.015) and 14 (P-value\u2009=\u20090.010) days after receiving the interventions.\nHowever, no significant difference in fever status was observed on days 1, 3, 7, and 14 in both groups (P-value >\u20090.05).\nThe results of the current study suggest that Levamisole may improve most of clinical status of patients with COVID-19.\nThe patients receiving Levamisole had significantly better chance of clinical status including cough and dyspnea on day 14 when compared to the placebo.\nHowever, the effect-size of this finding has uncertain clinical importance.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : The trial was registered as IRCT20190810044500N7 (19/09/2020).\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "clinical presentations", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 47, "end": 69}, {"term": "non-hospitalized
