{"doc_id": "33119613", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Effect of disease duration in a randomized Phase III trial of rintatolimod, an immune modulator for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.\nRintatolimod is a selective TLR3 agonist, which has demonstrated clinical activity for ME/CFS in Phase II and Phase III double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-site clinical trials.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS : A hypothesis-based post-hoc analysis of the Intent to Treat (ITT) population diagnosed with ME/CFS from 12 independent clinical sites of a Phase III trial was performed to evaluate the effect of rintatolimod therapy based on disease duration.\nThe clinical activity of rintatolimod was evaluated by exercise treadmill tolerance (ETT) using a modified Bruce protocol.\nThe ITT population (n = 208) was divided into two subsets of symptom duration.\nPatients with symptom duration of 2-8 years were identified as the Target Subset (n = 75); the remainder (<2 year plus >8 year) were identified as the Non-Target Subset (n = 133).\nPlacebo-adjusted percentage improvements in exercise duration and the vertical rise for the Target Subset (n = 75) were more than twice that of the ITT population.\nThe Non-Target Subset (n = 133) failed to show any clinically significant ETT response to rintatolimod when compared to placebo.\nWithin the Target Subset, 51.2% of rintatolimod-treated patients improved their exercise duration by \u226525% (p = 0.003) despite reduced statistical power from division of the original ITT population into two subsets.\nCONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE : Analysis of ETT from a Phase III trial has identified within the ITT population, a subset of ME/CFS patients with \u22652 fold increased exercise response to rintatolimod.\nSubstantial improvement in physical performance was seen for the majority (51.2%) of these severely debilitated patients who improved exercise duration by \u226525%.\nThis magnitude of exercise improvement was associated with clinically significant enhancements in quality of life.\nThe data indicate that ME/CFS patients have a relatively short disease duration window (<8 years) to expect a significant response to rintatolimod under the dosing conditions utilized in this Phase III clinical trial.\nThese results may have direct relevance to the cognitive impairment and fatigue being experienced by patients clinically recovered from COVID-19 and free of detectable SARS-CoV-2.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00215800.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term":
