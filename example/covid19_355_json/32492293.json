{"doc_id": "32492293", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "A Randomized Trial of Hydroxychloroquine as Postexposure Prophylaxis for Covid-19.\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) occurs after exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\nFor persons who are exposed, the standard of care is observation and quarantine.\nWhether hydroxychloroquine can prevent symptomatic infection after SARS-CoV-2 exposure is unknown.\nWe conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial across the United States and parts of Canada testing hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis.\nWe enrolled adults who had household or occupational exposure to someone with confirmed Covid-19 at a distance of less than 6 ft for more than 10 minutes while wearing neither a face mask nor an eye shield (high-risk exposure) or while wearing a face mask but no eye shield (moderate-risk exposure).\nWithin 4 days after exposure, we randomly assigned participants to receive either placebo or hydroxychloroquine (800 mg once, followed by 600 mg in 6 to 8 hours, then 600 mg daily for 4 additional days).\nThe primary outcome was the incidence of either laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 or illness compatible with Covid-19 within 14 days.\nWe enrolled 821 asymptomatic participants.\nOverall, 87.6% of the participants (719 of 821) reported a high-risk exposure to a confirmed Covid-19 contact.\nThe incidence of new illness compatible with Covid-19 did not differ significantly between participants receiving hydroxychloroquine (49 of 414 [11.8%]) and those receiving placebo (58 of 407 [14.3%]); the absolute difference was -2.4 percentage points (95% confidence interval, -7.0 to 2.2; P\u2009=\u20090.35).\nSide effects were more common with hydroxychloroquine than with placebo (40.1% vs. 16.8%), but no serious adverse reactions were reported.\nAfter high-risk or moderate-risk exposure to Covid-19, hydroxychloroquine did not prevent illness compatible with Covid-19 or confirmed infection when used as postexposure prophylaxis within 4 days after exposure.\n(Funded by David Baszucki and Jan Ellison Baszucki and others;
