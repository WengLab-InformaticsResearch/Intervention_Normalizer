that is, either a Christian identity or an economically motivated identity.\nParticipants were asked about their identity and then provided a control PSA and treatment PSA matching their identity, in random order.\nThe PSAs were of approximately 100 words.\nWe recruited 300 social media users from Amazon Mechanical Turk in accordance with usual protocols to ensure data quality.\nIn total, 8 failed the data quality checks, and the remaining 292 were included in the analysis.\nIn the identity-based PSA, the source of the PSA was changed, and a phrase of approximately 12 words relevant to the individual's identity was inserted.\nA PSA tailored for Christians, when matched with a Christian identity, increased the likelihood of compliance by 12 percentage points.\nA PSA that focused on economic values, when shown to individuals who identified as economically motivated, increased the likelihood of compliance by 6 points.\nUsing social media to deliver COVID-19 public health announcements customized to individuals' identities is a promising measure to increase compliance with public health guidelines.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : ISRCTN Registry 22331899;
