{"doc_id": "33198432", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Intraoperative aerosol box use: does an educational visual aid reduce contamination?\nThe aerosol box was rapidly developed and disseminated to minimize viral exposure during aerosolizing procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, yet users may not understand how to use and clean the device.\nThis could potentially lead to increased viral exposure to subsequent patients and practitioners.\nWe evaluated intraoperative contamination and aerosol box decontamination and the impact of a preoperative educational visual aid.\nUsing a double-blinded randomized design, forty-four anesthesiology trainees and faculty completed a simulated anesthetic case using an aerosol box contaminated with a fluorescent marker; half of the subjects received a visual aid prior to the simulation.\nIntraoperative contamination was evaluated at 10 standardized locations using an ultraviolet (UV) light.\nNext, subjects were instructed to clean the aerosol box for use on the next patient.\nFollowing cleaning, the box was evaluated for decontamination using an UV light.\nMedian total contamination score was significantly reduced in the experimental group (5.0 vs. 10.0, P < 0.001).\nThe aerosol box was completely cleaned by 36.4% of subjects in the experimental group compared to 4.5% in the control group (P = 0.009).\nThe use of a visual aid significantly decreased intraoperative contamination and improved box cleaning.\nDespite these findings, a potentially clinically significant amount of viral exposure may exist.\nThorough evaluation of the risks and benefits of the aerosol box should be completed prior to use.\nIf an aerosol box is used, a visual aid should be considered to remind practitioners how to best use and clean the box.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [], "Comparison Results": [], "Study Arm 1 Results": [], "Study Arm 2 Results": [], "Hypothesis": []}, "Sentence-level breakdown": [{"Section": "TITLE", "Text": "Intraoperative aerosol box use : does an educational visual aid reduce contamination ?", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [{"term": "Intraoperative aerosol box use", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 0, "end": 30}, {"term": "educational visual aid", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 41, "end": 63}], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [{"term": "reduce", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 64, "end": 70}], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "BACKGROUND", "Text": "The aerosol box was rapidly developed and disseminated to minimize viral exposure during aerosolizing procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic , yet users may not understand how to use and clean the device .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "BACKGROUND", "Text": "This could potentially lead to increased viral exposure to subsequent patients and practitioners .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "BACKGROUND", "Text": "We evaluated intraoperative contamination and aerosol box decontamination and the impact of a preoperative educational visual aid .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [{"term": "preoperative educational visual aid", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 94, "end": 129}], "Outcome": [{"term": "intraoperative contamination", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 13, "end": 41}, {"term": "aerosol box decontamination", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 46, "end": 73}], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "METHODS", "Text": "Using a double-blinded randomized design , forty-four anesthesiology trainees and faculty completed a simulated anesthetic case using an aerosol box contaminated with a fluorescent marker ;
