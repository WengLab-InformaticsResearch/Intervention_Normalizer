{"doc_id": "32747329", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Effect of an E-Learning Module on Personal Protective Equipment Proficiency Among Prehospital Personnel: Web-Based Randomized Controlled Trial.\nTo avoid misuse of personal protective equipment (PPE), ensure health care workers' safety, and avoid shortages, effective communication of up-to-date infection control guidelines is essential.\nAs prehospital teams are particularly at risk of contamination given their challenging work environment, a specific gamified electronic learning (e-learning) module targeting this audience might provide significant advantages as it requires neither the presence of learners nor the repetitive use of equipment for demonstration.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate whether a gamified e-learning module could improve the rate of adequate PPE choice by prehospital personnel in the context of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.\nThis was an individual-level randomized, controlled, quadruple-blind (investigators, participants, outcome assessors, and data analysts) closed web-based trial.\nAll emergency prehospital personnel working in Geneva, Switzerland, were eligible for inclusion, and were invited to participate by email in April 2020.\nParticipants were informed that the study aim was to assess their knowledge regarding PPE, and that they would be presented with both the guidelines and the e-learning module, though they were unaware that there were two different study paths.\nAll participants first answered a preintervention quiz designed to establish their profile and baseline knowledge.\nThe control group then accessed the guidelines before answering a second set of questions, and were then granted access to the e-learning module.\nThe e-learning group was shown the e-learning module right after the guidelines and before answering the second set of questions.\nOf the 291 randomized participants, 176 (60.5%) completed the trial.\nThere was no significant difference in baseline knowledge between groups.\nThough the baseline proportion of adequate PPE choice was high (75%, IQR 50%-75%), participants' description of the donning sequence was in most cases incorrect. After either intervention, adequate choice of PPE increased significantly in both groups (P<.001).\nThough the median of the difference in the proportion of correct answers was slightly higher in the e-learning group (17%, IQR 8%-33% versus 8%, IQR 8%-33%), the difference was not statistically significant (P=.27).\nConfidence in the ability to use PPE was maintained in the e-learning group (P=.27) but significantly decreased in the control group (P=.04).\nAmong prehospital personnel with an already relatively high knowledge of and experience with PPE use, both web-based study paths increased the rate of adequate choice of PPE.\nThere was no major added value of the gamified e-learning module apart from preserving participants' confidence in their ability to correctly use PPE.\n\u00a9Laurent Suppan, Mohamed Abbas, Loric Stuby, Philippe Cottet, Robert Larribau, Eric Golay, Anne Iten, Stephan Harbarth, Birgit Gartner, M\u00e9lanie Suppan.\nOriginally published in the
