{"doc_id": "33394524", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Nasopharyngeal swab-induced pain for SARS-CoV-2 screening: A randomised controlled trial of conventional and self-swabbing.\nMassive screening campaigns for SARS-CoV-2 are currently carried out throughout the world, relying on reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) following nasopharyngeal swabbing performed by a healthcare professional.\nYet, due to the apprehension of pain induced by nasopharyngeal probing, poor adhesion to those screening campaigns can be observed.\nTo enhance voluntary participation and to avoid unnecessary exposition to SARS-CoV-2, self-swabbing could be proposed.\nTo date, no data have been published concerning pain induced by conventional- or self-swabbing.\nThus, the primary objective of the present study was to evaluate pain induced with the conventional swabbing method and compare it to self-swabbing.\nSecondary objectives focused on swabbing-induced discomfort and acceptability of the two methods.\nThe study was conducted in Clermont-Ferrand medical school (France).\nOverall, 190 students were randomised into two groups and experienced either self- or conventional-swabbing.\nEach subject had to rate pain, discomfort and acceptability of such swabbing on a 0-10 numeric rating scale.\nNo significant difference was found between the two methods.\nThe mean pain level was 2.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9, 28% rating pain as \u22654/10.\nDiscomfort was 4.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2, 66% indicating significant (\u22654/10) discomfort.\nHigher pain and discomfort were associated with female sex.\nAcceptability was \u22658/10 for 89.0% of the subjects and all would have accepted to undergo a new test with the same technique if necessary.\nBoth conventional and self-swabbing induce low levels of pain for most young healthy volunteers whereas discomfort is very frequent.\nNonetheless, both methods are indifferently well-accepted in medical students.\nFuture studies amongst symptomatic subjects are awaited.\nUsing the thinnest available swabs, procedural pain induced by nasopharyngeal swabbing for SARS-CoV-2 screening is very low for most subjects and should not limit voluntary participation in screening campaigns.\nSelf-swabbing does not lead to more pain or discomfort compared to conventional swabbing, is well-accepted, and could be proposed to optimize screening campaigns, at least in healthcare professionals.\n\u00a9 2021 European Pain Federation - EFIC\u00ae.\n", "Evidence Map":
