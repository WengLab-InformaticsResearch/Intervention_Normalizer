controls received two infusions of vehicle solution.\nBoth groups received best standard of care.\nPrimary endpoint was safety (adverse events [AEs]) within 6 hours; cardiac arrest or death within 24\u2009hours postinfusion).\nSecondary endpoints included patient survival at 31\u2009days after the first infusion and time to recovery.\nNo difference was observed between groups in infusion-associated AEs.\nNo serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed related to UC-MSC infusions.\nUC-MSC infusions in COVID-19 ARDS were found to be safe.\nInflammatory cytokines were significantly decreased in UC-MSC-treated subjects at day 6.\nTreatment was associated with significantly improved patient survival (91% vs 42%, P =\u2009.015), SAE-free survival (P =\u2009.008), and time to recovery (P =\u2009.03).\nUC-MSC infusions are safe and could be beneficial in treating subjects with COVID-19 ARDS.\n\u00a9 2021 The Authors.\nSTEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of AlphaMed Press.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 42, "end": 86}, {"term": "COVID-19 ARDS", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 20, "end": 33}, {"term": "COVID-19 ARDS", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 76, "end": 89}], "Comparison Results": [], "Study Arm 1 Results": [], "Study Arm 2 Results": [], "Hypothesis": []}, "Sentence-level breakdown": [{"Section": "TITLE", "Text": "Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells for COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome : A double-blind , phase 1 / 2a , randomized controlled trial .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 42, "end": 86}], "Intervention": [{"term": "Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 0, "end": 37}], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) in COVID-19 is associated with high mortality .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "Mesenchymal stem cells are known to exert immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects and could yield beneficial effects in COVID-19 ARDS .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "The objective of this study was to determine safety and explore efficacy of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell ( UC-MSC ) infusions in subjects with COVID-19 ARDS .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [{"term": "umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell ( UC-MSC ) infusions", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 76, "end": 133}], "Outcome": [{"term": "safety", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 45, "end": 51}, {"term": "efficacy", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 64, "end": 72}], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "A double-blind , phase 1 / 2a , randomized , controlled trial was performed .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "Randomization and stratification by ARDS severity was used to foster balance among groups .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "All subjects were analyzed under intention to treat design .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "Twenty-four subjects were randomized 1:1 to either UC-MSC treatment ( n = 12 ) or the control group ( n = 12 ) .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [{"term": "UC-MSC treatment", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 51, "end": 67}, {"term": "control", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 86, "end": 93}], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "Subjects in the UC-MSC treatment group received two intravenous infusions ( at day 0 and 3 ) of 100 \u00b1 20 \u00d7 106 UC-MSCs ;
