{"doc_id": "33725772", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "A randomized trial in the investigation of anxiety and depression in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern.\nA small proportion of patients infected with COVID-19 go on to develop pneumonia.\nWe speculated that COVID-19 may be likely to result in psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression.\nIn this study, we conducted an investigation of anxiety and depression in patients with COVID-19.\nSixty-five COVID-19 patients were randomly enrolled into this study.\nAnxiety and depression among participants were measured through the completion of anonymous Chinese-language Zung self-rating anxiety scale and self-rating depression scale questionnaires.\nData were analyzed using independent samples t-tests, Mann-Whitney U-tests, and \u03c72 tests.\nThe questionnaire results showed that 26.15% and 41.54% of participants suffered from anxiety and depression, respectively, although there was no significantly statistical difference between the proportions of COVID-19 patients with anxiety and depression.\nStatistically significant differences in employment status, partial pressure of oxygen, and corticosteroid application existed between moderate- and severe COVID-19 patients (P<0.05).\nIn particular, the partial pressure of oxygen was significantly lower in severe COVID-19 patients than in their moderate counter parts (71.31\u00b123.54 vs. 101.06\u00b134.43, U=156, P=0.006).\nTotal lymphocytes was lower in severe group than in moderate group [1.659\u00b10.643 vs. 0.745 (0.645, 0.928), U=109, P=0.000].\nAlso, a higher proportion of female than male patients had anxiety (\u03c72=5.388, P=0.02).\nCOVID-19 patients who received antiviral medications also displayed a higher rate of anxiety (\u03c72=4.481, P=0.034).\nTotal lymphocytes between the non-anxiety and anxiety had statistical difference (U=321, P=0.019).\nMeanwhile, total lymphocytes between the non-depression and depression also had statistical difference (U=389.5, P=0.01).\nAmong patients with COVID-19, females and those treated with antiviral medications were more likely to experience anxiety.\nIn addition, our findings reflected the effect of anxiety and depression on immune system.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "coronavirus disease 2019 (", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 83, "end":
