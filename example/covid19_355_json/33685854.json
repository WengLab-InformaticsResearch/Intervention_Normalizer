{"doc_id": "33685854", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Impact of a Serious Game (Escape COVID-19) on the Intention to Change COVID-19 Control Practices Among Employees of Long-term Care Facilities: Web-Based Randomized Controlled Trial.\nMost residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are at high risk of complications and death following SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nIn these facilities, viral transmission can be facilitated by shortages of human and material resources, which can lead to suboptimal application of infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures.\nTo improve the dissemination of COVID-19 IPC guidelines, we developed a serious game called \"Escape COVID-19\" using Nicholson's RECIPE for meaningful gamification, as engaging serious games have the potential to induce behavioral change.\nAs the probability of executing an action is strongly linked to the intention of performing it, the objective of this study was to determine whether LTCF employees were willing to change their IPC practices after playing \"Escape COVID-19.\"\nThis was a web-based, triple-blind, randomized controlled trial, which took place between November 5 and December 4, 2020.\nThe health authorities of Geneva, Switzerland, asked the managers of all LTCFs under their jurisdiction to forward information regarding the study to all their employees, regardless of professional status.\nParticipants were unaware that they would be randomly allocated to one of two different study paths upon registration.\nIn the control group, participants filled in a first questionnaire designed to gather demographic data and assess baseline knowledge before accessing regular online IPC guidelines.\nThey then answered a second questionnaire, which assessed their willingness to change their IPC practices and identified the reasons underlying their decision.\nThey were then granted access to the serious game.\nConversely, the serious game group played \"Escape COVID-19\" after answering the first questionnaire but before answering the second one.\nThis group accessed the control material after answering the second set of questions.\nThere was no time limit.\nThe primary outcome was the proportion of LTCF employees willing to change their IPC practices.\nSecondary outcomes included the factors underlying participants' decisions, the domains these changes would affect, changes in the use of protective equipment items, and attrition at each stage of the study.\nA total of 295 answer sets were analyzed.\nWillingness to change behavior was higher in the serious game group (82% [119/145] versus 56% [84/150]; P<.001), with an odds ratio of 3.86 (95% CI 2.18-6.81; P<.001) after adjusting for professional category and baseline knowledge, using a mixed effects logistic regression model with LTCF as a random effect.\nFor more than two-thirds (142/203) of the participants, the feeling of playing an important role against the epidemic was the most important factor explaining their willingness to change behavior.\nMost of the participants unwilling to change their behavior answered that they were already applying all the guidelines.\nThe serious game \"Escape COVID-19\" was more successful than standard IPC material in convincing LTCF employees to adopt COVID-19-safe IPC behavior.\nINTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID) :
