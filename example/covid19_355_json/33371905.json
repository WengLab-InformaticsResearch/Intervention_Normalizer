{"doc_id": "33371905", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "COvid-19 and high-dose VITamin D supplementation TRIAL in high-risk older patients (COVIT-TRIAL): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.\nWith the lack of effective therapy, chemoprevention, and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, focusing on the immediate repurposing of existing drugs gives hope of curbing the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA recent unbiased genomics-guided tracing of the SARS-CoV-2 targets in human cells identified vitamin D among the three top-scoring molecules manifesting potential infection mitigation patterns.\nGrowing pre-clinical and epidemiological observational data support this assumption.\nWe hypothesized that vitamin D supplementation may improve the prognosis of COVID-19.\nThe aim of this trial is to compare the effect of a single oral high dose of cholecalciferol versus a single oral standard dose on all-cause 14-day mortality rate in COVID-19 older adults at higher risk of worsening.\nThe COVIT-TRIAL study is an open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled superiority trial.\nPatients aged \u2265\u200965\u2009years with COVID-19 (diagnosed within the preceding 3\u00a0days with RT-PCR and/or chest CT scan) and at least one worsening risk factor at the time of inclusion (i.e., age\u2009\u2265\u200975\u2009years, or SpO2\u2009\u2264\u200994% in room air, or PaO2/FiO2\u2009\u2264\u2009300\u2009mmHg), having no contraindications to vitamin D supplementation, and having received no vitamin D supplementation >\u2009800 IU/day during the preceding month are recruited.\nParticipants are randomized either to high-dose cholecalciferol (two 200,000\u2009IU drinking vials at once on the day of inclusion) or to standard-dose cholecalciferol (one 50,000\u2009IU drinking vial on the day of inclusion).\nTwo hundred sixty participants are recruited and followed up for 28\u2009days.\nThe primary outcome measure is all-cause mortality within 14\u2009days of inclusion.\nSecondary outcomes are the score changes on the World Health Organization Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (OSCI) scale for COVID-19, and the between-group comparison of safety.\nThese outcomes are assessed at baseline, day 14, and day 28, together with the serum concentrations of 25(OH)D, creatinine, calcium, and albumin at baseline and day 7.\nCOVIT-TRIAL is to our knowledge the first randomized controlled trial testing the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the prognosis of COVID-19 in high-risk older patients.\nHigh-dose vitamin D supplementation may be an effective, well-tolerated, and easily and immediately accessible treatment for COVID-19, the incidence of which increases dramatically and for which there are currently no scientifically validated treatments.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04344041 .\nRegistered on 14 April 2020 TRIAL STATUS: Recruiting.\nRecruitment is expected to be completed in April 2021.\n", "Evidence Map":
