{"doc_id": "32812039", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Sofosbuvir and daclatasvir compared with standard of care in the treatment of patients admitted to hospital with moderate or severe coronavirus infection (COVID-19): a randomized controlled trial.\nCurrently no effective antiviral therapy has been found to treat COVID-19.\nThe aim of this trial was to assess if the addition of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir improved clinical outcomes in patients with moderate or severe COVID-19.\nThis was an open-label, multicentre, randomized controlled clinical trial in adults with moderate or severe COVID-19 admitted to four university hospitals in Iran.\nPatients were randomized into a treatment arm receiving sofosbuvir and daclatasvir plus standard care, or a control arm receiving standard care alone.\nThe primary endpoint was clinical recovery within 14\u2009days of treatment.\nThe study is registered with IRCT.ir under registration number IRCT20200128046294N2.\nBetween 26 March and 26 April 2020, 66 patients were recruited and allocated to either the treatment arm (n\u2009=\u200933) or the control arm (n\u2009=\u200933).\nClinical recovery within 14\u2009days was achieved by 29/33 (88%) in the treatment arm and 22/33 (67%) in the control arm (P\u2009=\u20090.076).\nThe treatment arm had a significantly shorter median duration of hospitalization [6\u2009days (IQR 4-8)] than the control group [8\u2009days (IQR 5-13)]; P\u2009=\u20090.029.\nCumulative incidence of hospital discharge was significantly higher in the treatment arm versus the control (Gray's P\u2009=\u20090.041).\nThree patients died in the treatment arm and five in the control arm.\nNo serious adverse events were reported.\nThe addition of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir to standard care significantly reduced the duration of hospital stay compared with standard care alone.\nAlthough fewer deaths were observed in the treatment arm, this was not statistically significant.\nConducting larger scale trials seems prudent.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.\nPublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Society for Antimicrobial
