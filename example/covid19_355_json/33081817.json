{"doc_id": "33081817", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Proactive prophylaxis with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (ProPAC-COVID): a statistical analysis plan.\nThere is an urgent need for treatments that can shorten hospitalization and lower the risk of secondary infection and death in patients with corona disease.\nThe ProPac-COVID trial evaluates whether combination therapy with macrolide azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine via anti-inflammation/immune modulation, antiviral efficacy, and pre-emptive treatment of supra-infections can shorten hospitalization duration and reduce the risk of non-invasive ventilation, treatment in the intensive care unit, and death in patients with acute hospital admission and a positive test for 2019-nCoV and symptoms of COVID-19 disease.\nThe ProPAC-COVID is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial.\nThe primary outcome is number of days spent alive and out of hospital within 14\u2009days from randomization.\nRandomization will be in blocks of unknown size, and the final allocation will be stratified for age, site of recruitment, and whether the patient has any chronic lung diseases.\nData is analyzed using intention-to-treat (ITT) principles, and main analyses will also be subject to modified ITT analysis and per protocol analysis.\nThis paper describes the detailed statistical analysis plan for the evaluation of primary and secondary endpoints of the ProPAC-COVID study.\nEnrolment of patients to the ProPAC-COVID study is still ongoing.\nThe purpose of this paper is to provide primary publication of study results to prevent selective reporting of outcomes, data-driven analysis, and to increase transparency.\nTRIAL
