COVID-19 Related Olfactory Dysfunction.\nTo evaluate a therapeutic role for omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in the treatment of olfactory dysfunction associated with COVID-19 infection TRIAL DESIGN: Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial PARTICIPANTS: Eligible patients are adults with self-reported new-onset olfactory dysfunction of any duration associated with laboratory-confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19 patients.\nExclusion criteria include patients with pre-existing olfactory dysfunction, history of chronic rhinosinusitis or history of sinus surgery, current use of nasal steroid sprays or omega-3 supplementation, fish allergy, or inability to provide informed consent for any reason.\nThe trial is conducted at Mount Sinai Hospital INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The intervention group will receive 2000 mg daily of omega-3 supplementation in the form of two \"Fish Oil, Ultra Omega-3\" capsules (product of Pharmavite\u00ae) daily.\nThe comparator group will take 2 placebo capsules of identical size, shape, and odor daily for 6 weeks.\nMAIN OUTCOMES : Each subject will take a Brief Smell Identification Test at study enrolment and completion after 6 weeks.\nThe primary outcome will be change in Brief Smell Identification Test over the 6-week period.\nPatients will be randomized by the Investigational Drug Pharmacy at the Icahn School of Medicine at Sinai via a computer-generated sequence in a 1:1 allocation to treatment or control arms.\nBLINDING (MASKING) : Both participants and researchers will be blinded.\nNUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE) : There will be 88 participants randomized to each group.\nA total of 176 participants will be randomized.\nTRIAL STATUS : Protocol Version 1, 8/3/2020 Recruitment is ongoing, started 8/5/2020 with estimated completion 11/30/2020.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : The trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with Protocol Identifier: NCT04495816 .\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04495816 .\nRegistered 3 August 2020 FULL PROTOCOL: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file
