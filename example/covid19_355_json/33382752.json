{"doc_id": "33382752", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Rapid mixed-methods assessment of COVID-19 impact on Latinx sexual minority men and Latinx transgender women.\nWe conducted a rapid, mixed-methods assessment to understand how COVID-19 affected Latinx sexual minority men (LSMM) and transgender women (LTGW).\nUsing a computer-assisted telephone interviewing software, one interviewer called 52 participants (randomly sampled from a larger HIV prevention pilot study aiming to increase HIV knowledge and testing frequency; n = 36 LSMM and n = 16 LTGW) between 04/27/20-05/18/20.\nWe quantified core domains using the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory scale and provided important context through open-ended qualitative questions assessing: 1) COVID-19 infection history and experiences with quarantine; 2) Health and healthcare access; 3) Employment and economic impact of COVID-19.\nParticipants reported increases in physical conflict or verbal arguments with a partner (13.5%) or other adult(s) (19.2%) due to stressors associated with the safer-at-home order.\nParticipants also reported increased alcohol consumption (23.1%), problems with sleep (67.3%) and mental health (78.4%).\nFurther, disruptions in access to Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis or PrEP-a daily pill to prevent HIV-occurred (33.3% of 18 participants who reported being on PrEP).\nMany said they received less medical attention than usual (34.6%), and LTGW reported delays in critical gender-affirming hormones/procedures.\nHalf of the participants lost their jobs (50.0%); many undocumented participants relayed additional financial concerns because they did not qualify for financial assistance.\nThough no COVID-19 infections were noted, COVID-19 dramatically impacted other aspects of health and overall wellbeing of LSMM and LTGW.\nPublic health responses should address the stressors faced by LSMM and LTGW during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on wellbeing.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "Latinx sexual minority men", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 53, "end": 79}, {"term": "Latinx transgender women", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 84, "end": 108}, {"term": "Latinx sexual minority men ( LSMM )", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 84, "end": 119}], "Comparison Results": [], "Study Arm 1 Results": [], "Study Arm 2 Results": [], "Hypothesis": []}, "Sentence-level breakdown": [{"Section": "TITLE", "Text": "Rapid mixed-methods assessment of COVID-19 impact on Latinx sexual minority men and Latinx transgender women .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "Latinx sexual minority men", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 53, "end": 79}, {"term": "Latinx transgender women", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 84, "end": 108}], "Intervention": [{"term": "COVID-19", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 34, "end": 42}], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "We conducted a rapid , mixed-methods assessment to understand how COVID-19 affected Latinx sexual minority men ( LSMM ) and transgender women ( LTGW ) .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "Latinx sexual minority men ( LSMM )", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 84, "end": 119}], "Intervention": [{"term": "COVID-19", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 66, "end": 74}], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "Using a computer-assisted telephone interviewing software , one interviewer called 52 participants ( randomly sampled from a larger HIV prevention pilot study aiming to increase HIV knowledge and testing frequency ;
