{"doc_id": "33573699", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Safety and effectiveness of high-dose vitamin C in patients with COVID-19: a randomized open-label clinical trial.\nVitamin C is an essential water-soluble nutrient that functions as a key antioxidant and has been proven to be effective for boosting immunity.\nIn this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy of adding high-dose intravenous vitamin C (HDIVC) to the regimens for patients with severe COVID-19 disease.\nAn open-label, randomized, and controlled trial was conducted on patients with severe COVID-19 infection.\nThe case and control treatment groups each consisted of 30 patients.\nThe control group received lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine and the case group received HDIVC (6\u00a0g daily) added to the same regimen.\nThere were no statistically significant differences between two groups with respect to age and gender, laboratory results, and underlying diseases.\nThe mean body temperature was significantly lower in the case group on the 3rd day of hospitalization (p\u2009=\u20090.001).\nPeripheral capillary oxygen saturations (SpO2) measured at the 3rd day of hospitalization was also higher in the case group receiving HDIVC (p\u2009=\u20090.014).\nThe median length of hospitalization in the case group was significantly longer than the control group (8.5\u00a0days vs. 6.5\u00a0days) (p\u2009=\u20090.028).\nThere was no significant difference in SpO2 levels at discharge time, the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and mortality between the two groups.\nWe did not find significantly better outcomes in the group who were treated with HDIVC in addition to the main treatment regimen at discharge.\nTrial registration irct.ir
