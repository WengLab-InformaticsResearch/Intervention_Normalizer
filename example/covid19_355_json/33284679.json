Randomized Trial.\nEffective prevention against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is currently limited to nonpharmaceutical strategies.\nLaboratory and observational data suggested that hydroxychloroquine had biological activity against SARS-CoV-2, potentially permitting its use for prevention.\nTo test hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis for SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nHousehold-randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine postexposure prophylaxis.\n(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04328961).\nNational U.S. multicenter study.\nClose contacts recently exposed (<96 hours) to persons with diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nHydroxychloroquine (400 mg/d for 3 days followed by 200 mg/d for 11 days) or ascorbic acid (500 mg/d followed by 250 mg/d) as a placebo-equivalent control.\nParticipants self-collected mid-turbinate swabs daily (days 1 to 14) for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.\nThe primary outcome was PCR-confirmed incident SARS-CoV-2 infection among persons who were SARS-CoV-2 negative at enrollment.\nBetween March and August 2020, 671 households were randomly assigned: 337 (407 participants) to the hydroxychloroquine group and 334 (422 participants) to the control group.\nRetention at day 14 was 91%, and 10\u2009724 of 11\u2009606 (92%) expected swabs were tested.\nAmong the 689 (89%) participants who were SARS-CoV-2 negative at baseline, there was no difference between the hydroxychloroquine and control groups in SARS-CoV-2 acquisition by day 14 (53 versus 45 events; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.66]; P\u2009> 0.20).\nThe frequency of participants experiencing adverse events was higher in the hydroxychloroquine group than the control group (66 [16.2%] versus 46 [10.9%], respectively; P\u2009= 0.026).\nThe delay between exposure, and then baseline testing and the first dose of hydroxychloroquine or ascorbic acid, was a median of 2 days.\nThis rigorous randomized controlled trial among persons with recent exposure excluded a clinically meaningful effect of hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nPRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE : Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
