{"doc_id": "32335900", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "The impact of respiratory protective equipment on difficult airway management: a randomised, crossover, simulation study.\nThe current international COVID-19 health crisis underlines the importance of adequate and suitable personal protective equipment for clinical staff during acute airway management.\nThis study compares the impacts of standard air-purifying respirators and powered air-purifying respirators during simulated difficult airway scenarios.\nTwenty-five anaesthetists carried out four different standardised difficult intubation drills, either unprotected (control), or wearing a standard or a powered respirator.\nTreatment times and wearer comfort were determined and compared.\nIn the wearer comfort evaluation form, operators rated mobility, noise, heat, vision and speech intelligibility.\nAll anaesthetists accomplished the treatment objectives of all study arms without adverse events.\nTotal mean (SD) intubation times for the four interventions did not show significant differences between the powered and the standard respirator groups, being 16.4 (8.6) vs. 19.2 (5.2) seconds with the Airtraq\u2122; 11.4 (3.4) vs. 10.0 (2.1) seconds with the videolaryngoscope; 39.2 (4.5) vs. 40.1 (4.8) seconds with the fibreoptic bronchoscope scope; and 15.4 (5.7) vs. 15.1 (5.0) seconds for standard tracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy, respectively.\nVideolaryngoscopy allowed the shortest intubation times regardless of the respiratory protective device used.\nAnaesthetists rated heat and vision significantly higher in the powered respirator group; however, noise levels were perceived to be significantly lower than in the standard respirator group.\nWe conclude that standard and powered respirators do not significantly prolong simulated advanced intubation procedures.\n\u00a9 2020 Association of Anaesthetists.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "difficult airway scenarios", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 125, "end": 151}, {"term": "anaesthetists", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 12, "end": 25}, {"term": "anaesthetists", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 4, "end": 17}, {"term": "Anaesthetists", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 0, "end": 13}], "Comparison Results": [], "Study Arm 1 Results": [], "Study Arm 2 Results": [], "Hypothesis": []}, "Sentence-level breakdown": [{"Section": "TITLE", "Text": "The impact of respiratory protective equipment on difficult airway management : a randomised , crossover , simulation study .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [{"term": "respiratory protective equipment", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 14, "end": 46}], "Outcome": [{"term": "difficult airway management", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 50, "end": 77}], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "The current international COVID-19 health crisis underlines the importance of adequate and suitable personal protective equipment for clinical staff during acute airway management .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "This study compares the impacts of standard air-purifying respirators and powered air-purifying respirators during simulated difficult airway scenarios .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "difficult airway scenarios", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 125, "end": 151}], "Intervention": [{"term": "standard air-purifying respirators", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 35, "end": 69}, {"term": "powered air-purifying respirators", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 74, "end": 107}], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "Twenty-five anaesthetists carried out four different standardised difficult intubation drills , either unprotected ( control ) , or wearing a standard or a powered respirator .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "anaesthetists", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 12, "end": 25}], "Intervention": [{"term": "standardised difficult intubation drills", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 53, "end": 93}, {"term": "unprotected", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 103, "end": 114}, {"term": "control", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 117, "end": 124}, {"term": "standard", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 53, "end": 61}], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "Treatment times and wearer comfort were determined and compared .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [{"term": "Treatment times", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 0, "end": 15}, {"term": "wearer comfort", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 20, "end": 34}], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "In the wearer comfort evaluation form , operators rated mobility , noise , heat , vision and speech intelligibility .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [{"term": "mobility", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 56, "end": 64}, {"term": "noise", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 67, "end": 72}, {"term": "heat", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 75, "end": 79}], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "All anaesthetists accomplished the treatment objectives of all study arms without adverse events .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "anaesthetists", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 4, "end": 17}], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [{"term": "treatment objectives", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 35, "end": 55}, {"term": "adverse events", "negation": "negated", "UMLS": {}, "start": 82, "end": 96}], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "Total mean ( SD ) intubation times for the four interventions did not show significant differences between the powered and the standard respirator groups , being 16.4 ( 8.6 ) vs . 19.2 ( 5.2 ) seconds with the [UNK] ;
