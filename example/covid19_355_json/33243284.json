{"doc_id": "33243284", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Evaluating the efficacy and safety of the myrtle (Myrtus communis) in treatment and prognosis of patients suspected to novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.\nSince December 2019, the outbreak of coronavirus pneumonia was observed in China and quickly propagate in all of the world.\nNowadays, many trials are underway on this disease in which the efficacy of various therapeutic remedies including chemical or natural agents as well as different non-pharmacological methods such as acupuncture are evaluated.\nThis study aims at investigating the effect of M. communis fruit for treatment of COVID-19 disease.\nWe are performing an open-label randomized controlled trial on outpatients clinically suspected to COVID-19 disease in the age range of 18-65\u2009years old with mild to moderate symptoms and without respiratory distress.\nPatients in both groups (M. communis and control) receive conventional therapy, but those in M. communis group get M. communis preparation in addition to conventional therapy.\nIntervention will continue for 5\u2009days and the study outcomes including clinical status as well as mortality rate and adverse effects will be measured up to 14\u2009days.\nThe protocol describes the design of an ongoing randomized controlled trial to establish the evidence for the usage of water extract of M. communis fruit in clinically suspected COVID-19 disease and identify any safety concerns.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : The trial has been registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials website under the code\u00a0IRCT20180923041093N3 on March 28th, 2020 ( https://www.irct.ir/trial/46721 ).\nThe results will be disseminated through manuscript publications and presentations to scientific meetings.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "suspected to novel coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 )", "negation": "affirmed",
