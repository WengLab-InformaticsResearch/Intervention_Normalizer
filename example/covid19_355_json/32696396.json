{"doc_id": "32696396", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "A Small-Scale Medication of Leflunomide as a Treatment of COVID-19 in an Open-Label Blank-Controlled Clinical Trial.\nWe recently reported that inhibitors against human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) have broad-spectrum antiviral activities including their inhibitory efficacies on SARS-CoV-2 replication in infected cells.\nHowever, there are limited data from clinical studies to prove the application of DHODH inhibitors in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.\nIn the\u00a0present study, we evaluated Leflunomide, an approved DHODH inhibitor widely used as a modest immune regulator to treat autoimmune diseases, in treating COVID-19 disease with a small-scale of patients.\nCases of 10 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients of moderate type with obvious opacity in the lung were included.\nFive of the patients were treated with Leflunomide, and another five were treated as blank controls without a placebo.\nAll the patients accepted standard supportive treatment for COVID-19.\nThe patients given Leflunomide had a shorter viral shedding time (median of 5\u00a0days) than the controls (median of 11\u00a0days, P\u2009=\u20090.046).\nThe patients given Leflunomide also showed a significant reduction in C-reactive protein levels, indicating that immunopathological inflammation was well controlled.\nNo obvious adverse effects were observed in Leflunomide-treated patients, and they all discharged from the hospital faster than controls.\nThis preliminary study on a small-scale compassionate use of Leflunomide provides clues for further understanding of Leflunomide as a potential antiviral drug against COVID-19.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term":
