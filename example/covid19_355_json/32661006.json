{"doc_id": "32661006", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "A Randomized Clinical Trial of the Efficacy and Safety of Interferon \u03b2-1a in Treatment of Severe COVID-19.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is no published study on the use of interferon \u03b2-1a (IFN \u03b2-1a) in the treatment of severe COVID-19.\nIn this randomized clinical trial, the efficacy and safety of IFN \u03b2-1a were evaluated in patients with severe COVID-19.\nForty-two patients in the interferon group received IFN \u03b2-1a in addition to the national protocol medications (hydroxychloroquine plus lopinavir-ritonavir or atazanavir-ritonavir).\nEach 44-\u03bcg/ml (12 million IU/ml) dose of interferon \u03b2-1a was subcutaneously injected three times weekly for two consecutive weeks.\nThe control group consisted of 39 patients who received only the national protocol medications.\nThe primary outcome of the study was time to reach clinical response.\nSecondary outcomes were duration of hospital stay, length of intensive care unit stay, 28-day mortality, effect of early or late administration of IFN on mortality, adverse effects, and complications during the hospitalization.\nBetween 29 February and 3 April 2020, 92 patients were recruited, and a total of 42 patients in the IFN group and 39 patients in the control group completed the study.\nAs the primary outcome, time to the clinical response was not significantly different between the IFN and the control groups (9.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8 versus 8.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.9\u2009days, respectively, P\u2009=\u20090.95).\nOn day 14, 66.7% versus 43.6% of patients in the IFN group and the control group, respectively, were discharged (odds ratio [OR], 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05 to 6.37).\nThe 28-day overall mortality was significantly lower in the IFN than the control group (19% versus 43.6%, respectively, P = 0.015).\nEarly administration significantly reduced mortality (OR,\u200913.5; 95% CI, 1.5 to 118).\nAlthough IFN did not change the time to reach the clinical response, adding it to the national protocol significantly increased discharge rate on day 14 and decreased 28-day mortality.\n(This study is in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials under identifier IRCT20100228003449N28.).\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 American Society for Microbiology.\n", "Evidence
