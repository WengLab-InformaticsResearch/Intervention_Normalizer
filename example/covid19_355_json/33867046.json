{"doc_id": "33867046", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Efficacy and safety of Lianhuaqingwen capsules, a repurposed Chinese herb, in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: A multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial.\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has resulted in a global outbreak.\nFew existing targeted medications are available.\nLianhuaqingwen (LH) capsule, a repurposed marketed Chinese herb product, has been proven effective for influenza.\nTo determine the safety and efficacy of LH capsule in patients with Covid-19.\nWe did a prospective multicenter open-label randomized controlled trial on LH capsule in confirmed cases with Covid-19.\nPatients were randomized to receive usual treatment alone or in combination with LH capsules (4 capsules, thrice daily) for 14 days.\nThe primary endpoint was the rate of symptom (fever, fatigue, coughing) recovery.\nWe included 284 patients (142 each in treatment and control group) in the full-analysis set.\nThe recovery rate was significantly higher in treatment group as compared with control group (91.5% vs. 82.4%, p = 0.022).\nThe median time to symptom recovery was markedly shorter in treatment group (median: 7 vs. 10 days, p < 0.001).\nTime to recovery of fever (2 vs. 3 days), fatigue (3 vs. 6 days) and coughing (7 vs. 10 days) was also significantly shorter in treatment group (all p < 0.001).\nThe rate of improvement in chest computed tomographic manifestations (83.8% vs. 64.1%, p < 0.001) and clinical cure (78.9% vs. 66.2%, p = 0.017) was also higher in treatment group.\nHowever, both groups did not differ in the rate of conversion to severe cases or viral assay findings (both p > 0.05).\nNo serious adverse events were reported.\nIn light of the safety and effectiveness profiles, LH capsules could be considered to ameliorate clinical symptoms of Covid-19.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020.\nPublished by Elsevier GmbH.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term":
