{"doc_id": "30789856", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Ilaprazole Compared With Rabeprazole in the Treatment of Duodenal Ulcer: A Randomized, Double-blind, Active-controlled, Multicenter Study.\nThe main goal of this study was to explore the dose-effect relationship of ilaprazole.\nIlaprazole is a kind of benzimidazole proton-pump inhibitor, which was confirmed efficacious and safe in treatment of duodenal ulcer (DU).\nHowever, the dose-effect relationship of ilaprazole was not clear.\nThis was a double-blind, parallel, randomized study.\nPatients aged above 18 years with at least one endoscopically confirmed active nonmalignant DU were treated with rabeprazole 10\u2009mg or ilaprazole 10\u2009mg/5\u2009mg for 4 weeks.\nHealing of ulcer was determined by its resolution from active to scarring stage.\nSymptoms relief was evaluated using a graded score.\nSafety and tolerability were evaluated on basis of clinical assessments.\nA total of 390 patients completed the study finally.\nUlcers were successfully healed in 75.38%, 77.86%, and 83.72% of patients after 4-week treatment with rabeprazole 10\u2009mg, ilaprazole 5\u2009mg, and ilaprazole 10\u2009mg, respectively.\nThe 4-week healing rate difference between rabeprazole 10\u2009mg and ilaprazole 5\u2009mg was 2.48% (95% confidence interval: -7.79% to 12.74%) leading to accept the noninferiority hypothesis.\nLogistic regression model suggested that ilaprazole 10\u2009mg was superior to ilaprazole 5\u2009mg at week 2 (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval: 1.02, 3.59; P=0.04).\nMost patients (80%) became asymptomatic after treatment.\nAt the dosages administered, the 3 drug groups exhibited similar efficacy and a similar safety profile.\nIlaprazole 5\u2009mg is not inferior to rabeprazole 10\u2009mg in treating DU, and a dose-effect relationship have been revealed between 5\u2009mg and 10\u2009mg of ilaprazole.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term":
