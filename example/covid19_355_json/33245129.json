{"doc_id": "33245129", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Tubaramure, a Food-Assisted Integrated Health and Nutrition Program, Reduces Child Wasting in Burundi: A Cluster-Randomized Controlled Intervention Trial.\nLittle is known about the impact of food-assisted maternal and child health programs (FA-MCHN) on child wasting.\nWe assessed the impact of Tubaramure, a FA-MCHN program in Burundi, on child (0 to 24\u00a0months) wasting and the differential impacts by socio-economic characteristics and age.\nThe program targeted women and their children during the first 1000 days and included 1) food rations, 2) strengthening and promotion of use of health services, and 3) behavior change communication (BCC).\nWe conducted a 4-arm, cluster-randomized, controlled trial (2010-2012).\nClusters were defined as \"collines\" (communities).\nImpact was estimated using repeated cross-sectional data (n = \u223c2620 children in each round).\nTreatment arms received household and individual (mother or child in the first 1000 days) food rations (corn-soy blend and micronutrient-fortified vegetable oil) from pregnancy to 24\u00a0months (T24 arm), from pregnancy to 18\u00a0months (T18), or from birth to 24\u00a0months (TNFP).\nAll beneficiaries received the same BCC for the first 1000 days.\nThe control arm received no rations or BCC.\nWasting (weight-for-length Z-score <2 SD) increased from baseline to follow-up in the control group (from 6.5% to 8%), but Tubaramure had a significant (P <\u00a00.05) protective effect on wasting [treatment arms combined, -3.3 percentage points (pp); T18, -4.5 pp] and on the weight-for-length z-score (treatment arms combined, +0.15; T24, +0.20; T18, +0.17).\nThe effects were limited to children whose mother and household head had no education, and who lived in the poorest households.\nThe largest effect was found in children 6 to 12\u00a0months of age: the group with the highest wasting prevalence.\nFA-MCHN programs in highly food-insecure regions can protect the most disadvantaged children from wasting.\nThese findings are particularly relevant in the context of the economic crisis due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, which is expected to dramatically increase child wasting.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.\nPublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society for Nutrition.\n",
