(ii) the host ED site received COVID-19 patients; and (iii) reduced flow of patients otherwise presenting to the ED in non-pandemic conditions (e.g. after trauma).\nWe report on delivery of study procedures, recruitment, treatment adherence, outcome completion (primary outcome: number of intrusive memories during week 5), attrition, and limitations.\nThe information presented and limitations may enable our group and others to learn from this terminated study.\nTrial registration ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04185155 (04-12-2019).\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "trauma", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 73, "end": 79}, {"term": "Emergency Department", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 99, "end": 119}, {"term": "traumatic event", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 74, "end": 89}], "Comparison Results": [], "Study Arm 1 Results": [], "Study Arm 2 Results": [], "Hypothesis": []}, "Sentence-level breakdown": [{"Section": "TITLE", "Text": "A simple cognitive task intervention to prevent intrusive memories after trauma in patients in the Emergency Department : A randomized controlled trial terminated due to COVID-19 .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "trauma", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 73, "end": 79}, {"term": "Emergency Department", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 99, "end": 119}], "Intervention": [{"term": "simple cognitive task intervention", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 2, "end": 36}], "Outcome": [{"term": "intrusive memories", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 48, "end": 66}], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "OBJECTIVE", "Text": "This randomised controlled trial ( RCT ) aimed to investigate the effects of a simple cognitive task intervention on intrusive memories ( \" flashbacks \" ) and associated symptoms following a traumatic event .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [{"term": "simple cognitive task intervention", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 79, "end": 113}], "Outcome": [{"term": "intrusive memories ( \" flashbacks \" )", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 117, "end": 154}], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "OBJECTIVE", "Text": "Patients presenting to a Swedish emergency department ( ED ) soon after a traumatic event were randomly allocated ( 1:1 ) to the simple cognitive task intervention ( memory cue + mental rotation instructions + computer game \" Tetris \" for at least 20 min ) or control ( podcast , similar time ) .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "traumatic event", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 74, "end": 89}], "Intervention": [{"term": "simple cognitive task intervention", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 129, "end": 163}, {"term": "memory cue + mental rotation instructions + computer game \" Tetris \"", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 166, "end": 234}], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "OBJECTIVE", "Text": "We planned follow-ups at one-week , 1-month , and where possible , 3- and 6-months post-trauma .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "OBJECTIVE", "Text": "Anticipated enrolment was N=148 .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "RESULTS", "Text": "The RCT was terminated prematurely after recruiting N=16 participants .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "RESULTS", "Text": "The COVID-19 pandemic prevented recruitment / testing in the ED because : ( i ) the study required face-to-face contact between participants , psychology researchers , ED staff , and patients , incurring risk of virus transmission ;
