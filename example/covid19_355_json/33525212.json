is no study regarding the use of SOF/LDP in treatment of COVID-19.\n\u00a0 Objectives: In this study, the efficacy and safety of SOF/LDP were assessed in treatment of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.\nAmong an open-label randomized clinical trial, 82 patients with mild to moderated COVID-19 were assigned to receive either SOF/LDP 400/100 mg daily plus the standard of care (SOF/LDP group, n=42) or the standard of care alone (control group, n=40) for 10 days.\nTime to clinical response, rate of clinical response, duration of hospital and ICU stay and 14-day mortality were assessed.\nClinical response occurred in 91.46% of patients.\nAlthough rates of clinical response were comparable between the groups but it occurred faster in the SOF/LDP group than the control group (2 vs. 4 days respectively, P= 0.02).\nSupportive cares were provided in the medical wards for most patients but 17.07% of patients were transferred to ICU during the hospitalization course.\nHowever, durations of hospital and ICU stay were comparable between the groups.\n\u00a014--day mortality rate was 7.14% and 7.5% in the SOF/ LDP and control groups respectively.\nNo adverse effects leading to drug discontinuation occurred.\nGastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) were the most common side effects (15.85%).\nAdded to the standard of care, SOF/LDP accelerated time to the clinical response.\nHowever, rate of clinical response, duration of hospital and ICU stay and 14-day mortality were not different.\nNo significant adverse event was detected.\n\u00a0 More randomized clinical trials with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of SOF/LDP in the treatment of COVID-19.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "COVID-19", "negation":
