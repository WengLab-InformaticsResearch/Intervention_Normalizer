{"doc_id": "33246499", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "A randomized, multicentre, open-label phase II proof-of-concept trial investigating the clinical efficacy and safety of the addition of convalescent plasma to the standard of care in patients hospitalized with COVID-19: the Donated Antibodies Working against nCoV (DAWn-Plasma) trial.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has imposed an enormous burden on health care systems around the world.\nIn the past, the administration of convalescent plasma of patients having recovered from SARS and severe influenza to patients actively having the disease showed promising effects on mortality and appeared safe.\nWhether or not this also holds true for the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus is currently unknown.\nDAWn-Plasma is a multicentre nation-wide, randomized, open-label, phase II proof-of-concept clinical trial, evaluating the clinical efficacy and safety of the addition of convalescent plasma to the standard of care in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Belgium.\nPatients hospitalized with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 are eligible when they are symptomatic (i.e. clinical or radiological signs) and have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the 72\u2009h before study inclusion through a PCR (nasal/nasopharyngeal swab or bronchoalveolar lavage) or a chest-CT scan showing features compatible with COVID-19 in the absence of an alternative diagnosis.\nPatients are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either standard of care and convalescent plasma (active treatment group) or standard of care only.\nThe active treatment group receives 2\u2009units of 200 to 250\u2009mL of convalescent plasma within 12\u2009h after randomization, with a second administration of 2\u2009units 24 to 36\u2009h after ending the first administration.\nThe trial aims to include 483 patients and will recruit from 25 centres across Belgium.\nThe primary endpoint is the proportion of patients that require mechanical ventilation or have died at day 15.\nThe main secondary endpoints are clinical status on day 15 and day 30 after randomization, as defined by the WHO Progression 10-point ordinal scale, and safety of the administration of convalescent plasma.\nThis trial will either provide support or discourage the use of convalescent plasma as an early intervention for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04429854 .\nRegistered on 12 June 2020 - Retrospectively registered.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "hospitalized", "negation":
