{"doc_id": "33180097", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Fluvoxamine vs Placebo and Clinical Deterioration in Outpatients With Symptomatic COVID-19: A Randomized Clinical Trial.\nImportance : Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may lead to serious illness as a result of an excessive immune response.\nFluvoxamine may prevent clinical deterioration by stimulating the \u03c3-1 receptor, which regulates cytokine production.\nObjective : To determine whether fluvoxamine, given during mild COVID-19 illness, prevents clinical deterioration and decreases the severity of disease.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants : Double-blind, randomized, fully remote (contactless) clinical trial of fluvoxamine vs placebo.\nParticipants were community-living, nonhospitalized adults with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, with COVID-19 symptom onset within 7 days and oxygen saturation of 92% or greater.\nOne hundred fifty-two participants were enrolled from the St Louis metropolitan area (Missouri and Illinois) from April 10, 2020, to August 5, 2020.\nThe final date of follow-up was September 19, 2020.\nInterventions : Participants were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg of fluvoxamine (n\u2009=\u200980) or placebo (n\u2009=\u200972) 3 times daily for 15 days.\nMain Outcomes and Measures : The primary outcome was clinical deterioration within 15 days of randomization defined by meeting both criteria of (1) shortness of breath or hospitalization for shortness of breath or pneumonia and (2) oxygen saturation less than 92% on room air or need for supplemental oxygen to achieve oxygen saturation of 92% or greater.\nResults : Of 152 patients who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 46 [13] years; 109 [72%] women), 115 (76%) completed the trial.\nClinical deterioration occurred in 0 of 80 patients in the fluvoxamine group and in 6 of 72 patients in the placebo group (absolute difference, 8.7% [95% CI, 1.8%-16.4%] from survival analysis; log-rank P\u2009=\u2009.009).\nThe fluvoxamine group had 1 serious adverse event and 11 other adverse events, whereas the placebo group had 6 serious adverse events and 12 other adverse events.\nConclusions and Relevance : In this preliminary study of adult outpatients with symptomatic COVID-19, patients treated with fluvoxamine, compared with placebo, had a lower likelihood of clinical deterioration over 15 days.\nHowever, the study is limited by a small sample size and short follow-up duration, and determination of clinical efficacy would require larger randomized trials with more definitive outcome measures.\nTrial Registration : ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04342663.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "Outpatients", "negation":
