Group 2 completed Questionnaire 2, which did not include this information.\nA control group did not receive any questionnaire.\nAs measures were implemented, the number of blood donors increased accordingly.\nBoth first-time and repeat SWBDs perceived the same level of blood need and donated blood because it would save lives.\nSWBDs who completed Questionnaire 1 expressed a greater intention to donate during the epidemic.\nEnabling blood donors to perceive a higher level of blood need and a lower level of COVID-19 infection risk related to blood donation mobilized experienced SWBDs to donate within 3\u2009weeks.\nIntention-to-treat analyses and average-treatment-effect-on-the-treated estimations confirmed that Questionnaire 1 could motivate SWBDs to actually donate blood.\nVarious measures could ease blood shortage during the COVID-19 epidemic.\nAdministration of Questionnaire 1 could increase blood donations during the epidemic.\n\u00a9 2020 AABB.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "COVID-19", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 86, "end": 94}, {"term": "street whole blood donors ( SWBDs )", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 162, "end": 197}, {"term": "SWBDs", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 0, "end": 5}, {"term": "blood donors", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 9, "end": 21}, {"term": "blood donation mobilized", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 119, "end": 143}, {"term": "SWBDs", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 130, "end": 135}], "Comparison Results": [], "Study Arm 1 Results": [], "Study Arm 2 Results": [], "Hypothesis": []}, "Sentence-level breakdown": [{"Section": "TITLE", "Text": "Blood donor recruitment in Guangzhou , China , during the 2019 novel coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) epidemic .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "BACKGROUND", "Text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) epidemic affected blood collection in Guangzhou , China .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS : This paper includes three studies .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "The observational study reported the trends of blood collection during the epidemic in Guangzhou , China .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [{"term": "blood collection", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 47, "end": 63}], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "The cross-sectional survey investigated factors influencing blood donation during the COVID-19 epidemic , and a self-administered questionnaire was given to 1584 street whole blood donors ( SWBDs ) who donated during the epidemic .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "COVID-19", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 86, "end": 94}, {"term": "street whole blood donors ( SWBDs )", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 162, "end": 197}], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [{"term": "blood donation", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 60, "end": 74}], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "The randomized controlled trial involved 19 491 SWBDs who donated in 2019 but did not donate during the epidemic .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "Trial participants were randomly assigned to two intervention groups : Group 1 completed Questionnaire 1 , which contained precautionary measures in response to COVID-19 and other messages about blood donation during the epidemic ;
