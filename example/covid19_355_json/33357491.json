{"doc_id": "33357491", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Risks of and risk factors for COVID-19 disease in people with diabetes: a cohort study of the total population of Scotland.\nWe aimed to ascertain the cumulative risk of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in people with diabetes and compare it with that of people without diabetes, and to investigate risk factors for and build a cross-validated predictive model of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 among people with diabetes.\nIn this cohort study, we captured the data encompassing the first wave of the pandemic in Scotland, from March 1, 2020, when the first case was identified, to July 31, 2020, when infection rates had dropped sufficiently that shielding measures were officially terminated.\nThe participants were the total population of Scotland, including all people with diabetes who were alive 3 weeks before the start of the pandemic in Scotland (estimated Feb 7, 2020).\nWe ascertained how many people developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in this period from the Electronic Communication of Surveillance in Scotland database (on virology), the RAPID database of daily hospitalisations, the Scottish Morbidity Records-01 of hospital discharges, the National Records of Scotland death registrations data, and the Scottish Intensive Care Society and Audit Group database (on critical care).\nAmong people with fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19, diabetes status was ascertained by linkage to the national diabetes register, Scottish Care Information Diabetes.\nWe compared the cumulative incidence of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in people with and without diabetes using logistic regression.\nFor people with diabetes, we obtained data on potential risk factors for fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 from the national diabetes register and other linked health administrative databases.\nWe tested the association of these factors with fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in people with diabetes, and constructed a prediction model using stepwise regression and 20-fold cross-validation.\nOf the total Scottish population on March 1, 2020 (n=5\u2008463\u2008300), the population with diabetes was 319\u2008349 (5\u00b78%), 1082 (0\u00b73%) of whom developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 by July 31, 2020, of whom 972 (89\u00b78%) were aged 60 years or older.\nIn the population without diabetes, 4081 (0\u00b71%) of 5\u2008143\u2008951 people developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19.\nAs of July 31, the overall odds ratio (OR) for diabetes, adjusted for age and sex, was 1\u00b7395 (95% CI 1\u00b7304-1\u00b7494; p<0\u00b70001, compared with the risk in those without diabetes.\nThe OR was 2\u00b7396 (1\u00b7815-3\u00b7163; p<0\u00b70001) in type 1 diabetes and 1\u00b7369 (1\u00b7276-1\u00b7468; p<0\u00b70001) in type 2 diabetes.\nAmong people with diabetes, adjusted for age, sex, and diabetes duration and type, those who developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 were more likely to be male, live in residential care or a more deprived area, have a COVID-19 risk condition, retinopathy, reduced renal function, or worse glycaemic control, have had a diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycaemia hospitalisation in the past 5 years, be on more anti-diabetic and other medication (all p<0\u00b70001), and have been a smoker (p=0\u00b70011).\nThe cross-validated predictive model of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in people with diabetes had a C-statistic of 0\u00b785 (0\u00b783-0\u00b786).\nOverall risks of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 were substantially elevated in those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes compared with the background population.\nThe risk of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19, and therefore the need for special protective measures, varies widely among those with diabetes but can be predicted reasonably well using previous clinical history.\nNone.\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
