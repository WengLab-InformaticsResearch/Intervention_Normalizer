{"doc_id": "33338232", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Sofosbuvir and daclatasvir for the treatment of COVID-19 outpatients: a double-blind, randomized controlled trial.\nEffective treatments are urgently needed to tackle the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nThis trial aims to evaluate sofosbuvir and daclatasvir versus standard care for outpatients with mild COVID-19 infection.\nThis was a randomized controlled clinical trial in outpatients with mild COVID-19.\nPatients were randomized into a treatment arm receiving sofosbuvir/daclatasvir plus hydroxychloroquine or a control arm receiving hydroxychloroquine alone.\nThe primary endpoint of the trial was symptom alleviation after 7\u2009days of follow-up.\nThe secondary endpoint of the trial was hospital admission.\nFatigue, dyspnoea and loss of appetite were investigated after 1\u2009month of follow-up.\nThis study is registered with the IRCT.ir under registration number IRCT20200403046926N1.\nBetween 8 April 2020 and 19 May 2020, 55 patients were recruited and allocated to either the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir treatment arm (n\u2009=\u200927) or the control arm (n\u2009=\u200928).\nBaseline characteristics were similar across treatment arms.\nThere was no significant difference in symptoms at Day 7.\nOne patient was admitted to hospital in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir arm and four in the control arm, but the difference was not significant.\nAfter 1\u2009month of follow-up, two patients reported fatigue in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir arm and 16 in the control arm; P\u2009<\u20090.001.\nIn this study, sofosbuvir/daclatasvir did not significantly alleviate symptoms after 7\u2009days of treatment compared with control.\nAlthough fewer hospitalizations were observed in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir arm, this was not statistically significant.\nSofosbuvir/daclatasvir significantly reduced the number of patients with fatigue and dyspnoea after 1\u2009month.\nLarger, well-designed trials are warranted.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.\nPublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy.\nAll
