{"doc_id": "32854761", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Acupressure therapy and Liu Zi Jue Qigong for pulmonary function and quality of life in patients with severe novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19): a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.\nIn December 2019, pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China.\nThe number of cases has increased rapidly.\nPatients with severe disease have a poor prognosis, and there are no effective therapies for COVID-19.\nOnly rapid advice guidelines for symptomatic supportive care have been used.\nA traditional Chinese medicine rehabilitation (TCMR) program consisting of acupressure therapy and Liu Zi Jue Qigong can be used as a complementary therapy for COVID-19.\nHence, we designed a randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy and advantages of TCMR for treating patients with severe COVID-19.\nMETHODS/DESIGN : This is a parallel-design, two-arm, analyst assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial.\nA total of 128 patients with COVID-19 aged from 20 to 80\u2009years will be recruited and assigned randomly into a guideline therapy group and a guideline therapy plus TCMR group at a 1:1 ratio.\nPatients in both groups will receive guideline therapy.\nThe patients in the intervention group will perform acupressure therapy and Liu Zi Jue Qigong exercises in addition to conventional treatments twice a day and will be persistent from admission to discharge.\nThe primary outcome will be measured with the Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale, and the secondary outcomes will include the Activities of Daily Living Barthel Index Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Scale, and the Respiratory Symptoms Scale.\nThe assessments of the clinical scales will be performed at three points (before treatment, the 7th day during hospitalization, and the discharge day).\nAdverse events will be noted and recorded for the safety evaluation.\nThis trial will provide high-quality evidence of the value of TCMR, which consists of acupressure therapy and Liu Zi Jue Qigong exercises, for treating patients with severe COVID-19.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR2000029994 .\nRegistered on 18 February 2020.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "severe novel coronavirus pneumonia (
