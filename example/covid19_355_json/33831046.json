95% CI, 0.7-6.5; p = 0.157) or day 28 (OR 1.1; 95% CI, 0.4-3.6; p = 0.82).\nThere also was no evidence of an improvement in ventilator-free survival at day 14 (OR 0.8; 95% CI, 0.18-3.5; p = 0.75) or day 28 (OR 1.1; 95% CI, 0.1-1.8; p = 0.23).\nThere was no increase in secondary bacterial infection rates in the tocilizumab group compared to controls (OR 0.37; 95% CI, 0.09-1.53; p = 0.168).\nThere was no evidence to support an improvement in hypoxemia or ventilator-free survival with use of tocilizumab 400 mg in the absence of corticosteroids.\nNo increase in secondary bacterial infections was observed in the group receiving tocilizumab.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "COVID-19", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 48, "end": 56}, {"term": "absence of corticosteroids", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 127, "end": 153}], "Comparison Results": [], "Study Arm 1 Results": [], "Study Arm 2 Results": [], "Hypothesis": []}, "Sentence-level breakdown": [{"Section": "TITLE", "Text": "What about tocilizumab ?", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [{"term": "tocilizumab", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 11, "end": 22}], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "TITLE", "Text": "A retrospective study from a NYC Hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "BACKGROUND", "Text": "Tocilizumab , an interleukin-6 receptor blocker , has been used in the inflammatory phase of COVID-19 , but its impact independent of corticosteroids remains unclear in patients with severe disease .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "METHODS", "Text": "In this retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 admitted between March 2 and April 14 , 2020 to a large academic medical center in New York City , we describe outcomes associated with tocilizumab 400 mg ( without methylprednisolone ) compared to a propensity-matched control .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "COVID-19", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 48, "end": 56}], "Intervention": [{"term": "tocilizumab 400 mg ( without methylprednisolone )", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 193, "end": 242}], "Outcome": [{"term": "outcomes", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 168, "end": 176}], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "METHODS", "Text": "The primary endpoints were change in a 7-point ordinal scale of oxygenation and ventilator free survival , both at days 14 and 28 .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [{"term": "change in a 7-point ordinal scale of oxygenation", "negation": "negated", "UMLS": {}, "start": 27, "end": 75}, {"term": "ventilator free survival", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 80, "end": 104}], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "METHODS", "Text": "Secondary endpoints include incidence of bacterial superinfections and gastrointestinal perforation .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [{"term": "incidence of bacterial superinfections and gastrointestinal perforation", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 28, "end": 99}], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "METHODS", "Text": "Primary outcomes were evaluated using t-test .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "RESULTS", "Text": "We identified 33 patients who received tocilizumab and matched 74 controls based on demographics and health measures upon admission .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [{"term": "tocilizumab", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 39, "end": 50}, {"term": "controls", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 66, "end": 74}], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "RESULTS", "Text": "After adjusting for illness severity and baseline ordinal scale , we failed to find evidence of an improvement in hypoxemia based on an ordinal scale at hospital day 14 in the tocilizumab group ( OR 2.2 ;
