{"doc_id": "33302976", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Nebulised surfactant for the treatment of severe COVID-19 in adults (COV-Surf): A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.\nSARS-Cov-2 virus preferentially binds to the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) on alveolar epithelial type II cells, initiating an inflammatory response and tissue damage which may impair surfactant synthesis contributing to alveolar collapse, worsening hypoxia and leading to respiratory failure.\nThe objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of nebulised surfactant in COVID-19 adult patients requiring mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure.\nTRIAL DESIGN : This study is a dose-escalating randomized open-label clinical trial of 20 COVID-19 patients.\nThis study is conducted in two centres: University Hospital Southampton and University College London Hospitals.\nEligible participants are aged \u226518, hospitalised with COVID-19 (confirmed by PCR), who require endotracheal intubation and are enrolled within 24 hours of mechanical ventilation.\nFor patients unable to consent, assent is obtained from a personal legal representative (PerLR) or professional legal representative (ProfLR) prior to enrolment.\nThe following are exclusion criteria: imminent expected death within 24 hours; specific contraindications to surfactant administration (e.g. known allergy, pneumothorax, pulmonary hemorrhage); known or suspected pregnancy; stage 4 chronic kidney disease or requiring dialysis (i.e., eGFR < 30); liver failure (Child-Pugh Class C); anticipated transfer to another hospital, which is not a study site, within 72 hours; current or recent (within 1 month) participation in another study that, in the opinion of the investigator, would prevent enrollment for safety reasons; and declined consent or assent.\nINTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR : Intervention: The study is based on an investigational drug/device combination product.\nThe surfactant product is Bovactant (Alveofact\u00ae), a natural animal derived (bovine) lung surfactant formulated as a lyophilized powder in 108 mg vials and reconstituted to 45 mg/mL in buffer supplied in a prefilled syringe.\nIt is isolated by lung lavage and, by weight, is a mixture of: phospholipid (75% phosphatidylcholine, 13% phosphatidylglycerol, 3% phosphatidylethanolamine, 1% phosphatidylinositol and 1% sphingomyelin), 5% cholesterol, 1% lipid-soluble surfactant-associated proteins (SP-B and SP-C), very low levels of free fatty acid, lyso-phosphatidylcholine, water and 0.3% calcium.\nThe Drug Delivery Device is the AeroFact-COVID\u2122 nebulizer, an investigational device based on the Aerogen\u00ae Solo vibrating mesh nebulizer.\nThe timing and escalation dosing plans for the surfactant are as follows.\nCohort 1: Three patients will receive 10 vials (1080 mg) each of surfactant at dosing times of 0 hours, 8 hours and 24 hours.\n2 controls with no placebo intervention.\nCohort 2: Three patients will receive 10 vials (1080 mg) of surfactant at dosing times of 0 hours and 8 hours, and 30 vials (3240 mg) at a dosing time of 24 hours.\n2 controls with no placebo intervention.\nCohort 3: Three patients will receive 10 vials (1080 mg) of surfactant at a dosing time of 0 hours, and 30 vials (3240 mg) at dosing times of 8 hours and 24 hours.\n2 controls with no placebo intervention.\nCohort 4: Three patients will receive 30 (3240 mg) vials each of surfactant at dosing times of 0 hours, 8 hours and 24 hours.\n2 controls.\n2 controls with no placebo intervention.\nThe trial steering committee, advised by the data monitoring committee, will review trial progression and dose escalation/maintenance/reduction after each cohort is completed (48-hour primary outcome timepoint reached) based on available feasibility, adverse event, safety and efficacy data.\nThe trial will not be discontinued on the basis of lack of efficacy.\nThe trial may be stopped early on the basis of safety or feasibility concerns.\nComparator: No placebo intervention.\nAll participants will receive usual standard of care in accordance with the local policies for mechanically ventilated patients and all other treatments will be left to the discretion of the attending physician.\nMAIN OUTCOMES : The co-primary outcome is the improvement in oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2 ratio) and pulmonary ventilation (Ventilation Index (VI), where VI = [RR x (PIP - PEEP) \u00d7 PaCO2]/1000) at 48 hours after study initiation.\nThe secondary outcomes include frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), Adverse Device Effects (ADEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Serious Adverse Device Events (SADEs), change in pulmonary compliance, change in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) requirement of ventilatory support at 24 and 48 hours after study initiation, clinical improvement defined by time to one improvement point on the ordinal scale described in the WHO master protocol (2020) recorded while hospitalised, days of mechanical ventilation, mechanical ventilator free days (VFD) at day 21, length of intensive care unit stay, number of days hospitalised and mortality at day 28.\nExploratory end points will include quantification of SARS-CoV-2 viral load from tracheal aspirates using PCR, surfactant dynamics (synthesis and turnover) and function (surface tension reduction) from deep tracheal aspirate samples (DTAS), surfactant phospholipid concentrations in plasma and DTAS, inflammatory markers (cellular and cytokine) in plasma and DTAS, and blood oxidative stress markers.\nAfter informed assent, patients fulfilling inclusion criteria will be randomised to 3:2 for the treatment and control arms using an internet-based block randomization service (ALEA tool for clinical trials, FormsVision BV) in combination with electronic data collection.\nRandomisation will be done by the recruiting centre with a unique subject identifier specific to that centre.\nBLINDING (MASKING) : This is an open-labelled unblinded study.\nNUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE) :\nThe total sample size is 20 COVID-19 mechanically ventilated patients (12 intervention; 8 control).\nTRIAL STATUS : Current protocol version is V2 dated 5th of June 2020.\nThe recruitment is currently ongoing and started on the 14th of October 2020.\nThe anticipated study completion date is November 2021.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04362059 (Registered 24 April 2020), EUDAMED
