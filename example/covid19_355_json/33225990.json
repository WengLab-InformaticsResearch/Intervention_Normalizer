{"doc_id": "33225990", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Prone positioning in non-intubated patients with COVID-19 associated acute respiratory failure, the PRO-CARF trial: A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.\nTo assess the effect of prone positioning therapy on intubation rate in awake patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory failure.\nTRIAL DESIGN : This is a two-center parallel group, superiority, randomized (1:1 allocation ratio) controlled trial.\nAll patients admitted to the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara and Hospital General de Occidente in Mexico for COVID-19 associated acute respiratory failure and in need of supplementary oxygen through high-flow nasal cannula are screened for eligibility.\nINCLUSION CRITERIA : all adult patients admitted to the COVID-19 unit who test positive for COVID-19 by PCR-test and in need for oxygen are eligible for inclusion.\nRandomization starts upon identification of requirement of a fraction of inspired oxygen \u226530% for an oxygen capillary saturation of \u226590% Exclusion criteria: less than 18 years-old, pregnancy, patients with immediate need of invasive mechanical ventilation (altered mental status, fatigue), vasopressor requirement to maintain median arterial pressure >65 mmHg, contraindications for prone positioning therapy (recent abdominal or thoracic surgery or trauma, facial, pelvic or spine fracture, untreated pneumothorax, do-not-resuscitate or do-not-intubate order, refusal or inability of the patient to enroll in the study.\nINTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR : Patients of the intervention group will be asked to remain in a prone position throughout the day as long as possible, with breaks according to tolerance.\nPillows will be offered for maximizing comfort at chest, pelvis and knees.\nMonitoring of vital signs will not be suspended.\nInspired fraction of oxygen will be titrated to maintain a capillary saturation of 92%-95%.\nFor patients in the control group, prone positioning will be allowed as a rescue therapy.\nStaff intensivists will monitor the patient's status in both groups on a 24/7 basis.\nAll other treatment will be unchanged and left to the attending physicians.\nMAIN OUTCOMES : Endotracheal intubation rate for mechanical ventilation at 28 days.\nPatients will be randomly allocated to either prone positioning or control group at 1:1 ratio.\nSuch randomization will be computer generated and stratified by center with permuted blocks and length of 4.\nBLINDING (MASKING) : Due to logistical reasons, only principal investigators and the data analyst will be blinded to group assignment.\nNUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE) : With an intubation rate of 60% according to recent reports from some American centers, and\nassuming a decrease to 40% to be clinically relevant, we calculated a total of 96 patients per group, for a beta error of 0.2, and alpha of 0.5.\nTherefore, we plan to recruit 200 patients, accounting for minimal losses to follow up, with 100 non-intubated patients in the prone position group and a 100 in the control group.\nTRIAL STATUS : The local registration number is 048-20, with the protocol version number 2.0.\nThe date of approval is 3rd May 2020.\nRecruitment started on 3rd May and is expected to end in December 2020.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : The protocol was retrospectively registered under the title: \"Prone Positioning in Non-intubated Patients With COVID-19 Associated Acute Respiratory Failure.\nThe PRO-CARF trial\" in ClinicalTrials.gov with the registration number: NCT04477655.\nRegistered on 20 July 2020.\nFULL PROTOCOL : The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1).\nIn the interest in expediting dissemination of this material, the familiar formatting has been eliminated; this Letter serves as a summary of the key elements of the full protocol.\nThe study protocol has been reported in accordance with the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Clinical Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines (Additional file 2).\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term":
