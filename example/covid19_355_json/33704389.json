Clinical Trial.\nImportance : During the COVID-19 pandemic, wearing masks has become necessary, especially within health care.\nHowever, to our knowledge, the consequences of mask wearing on communication between surgeons and patients have not been studied.\nObjective : To evaluate the effects of clear vs standard covered masks on communication during surgical clinic encounters.\nDesign : This randomized clinical trial examined communication between surgeons and their patients when surgeons wore clear vs covered masks in surgical outpatient clinics at a single academic medical center.\nNew patients were recruited from participating surgeons' clinic schedules.\nInterventions : Surgeons wore either clear masks or covered masks for each clinic visit with a new patient, based on a per-visit randomization plan.\nMain Outcomes and Measures : The primary outcome measures included patient perceptions of (1) surgeon communication and (2) trust in surgeons, as well as (3) quantitative assessments and (4) qualitative assessments regarding patient impressions of the surgeon's mask.\nAfter the clinic encounter, patients completed a verbal survey including validated Clinician and Group Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems questions.\nAdditional questions involved surgeon empathy, trust, and the patient's impression of the surgeon's mask.\nData were analyzed by comparing patient data in the clear vs covered groups using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests, and comments were analyzed for themes.\nResults : Two hundred patients were enrolled from 15 surgeons' clinics spanning 7 subspecialties.\nWhen surgeons wore a clear mask, patients rated their surgeons higher for providing understandable explanations (clear, 95 of 100 [95%] vs covered, 78 of 100 [78%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), demonstrating empathy (clear, 99 [99%] vs covered, 85 [85%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and building trust (clear, 94 [94%] vs covered, 72 [72%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001).\nPatients preferred clear masks (clear, 100 [100%] vs covered, 72 [72%]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), citing improved surgeon communication and appreciation for visualization of the face.\nConversely, 8 of 15 surgeons (53%) were unlikely to choose the clear mask over their standard covered mask.\nConclusions and Relevance : This randomized clinical trial demonstrates that patients prefer to see their surgeon's face.\nSurgeons who wore clear masks were perceived by patients to be better communicators, have more empathy, and elicit greater trust.\nBecause masks will remain part of the health care landscape for some time, deliberate attention to preserving communication within the surgeon-patient relationship is warranted.\nTrial Registration : ClinicalTrials.gov
