{"doc_id": "32812025", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Evaluation of the efficacy of sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir in combination with ribavirin for hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate disease compared with standard care: a single-centre, randomized controlled trial.\nNew therapeutic options are urgently needed to tackle the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nRepurposing existing pharmaceuticals provides an immediate treatment opportunity.\nWe assessed the efficacy of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir with ribavirin for treating patients with COVID-19.\nThis was a single-centre, randomized controlled trial in adults with moderate COVID-19 admitted to the Ghaem Shahr Razi Hospital in Mazandaran Province, Iran.\nPatients were randomly assigned to 400\u2009mg sofosbuvir, 60\u2009mg daclatasvir and 1200\u2009mg ribavirin (intervention group) or to standard care (control group).\nThe primary endpoint of this study was length of hospital stay.\nThis study is registered by IRCT.ir under the ID: IRCT20200328046886N1.\nBetween 20 March 2020 and 8 April 2020, 48 patients were recruited; 24 patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 24 to the control group.\nThe median duration of hospital stay was 6\u2009days in both groups (P\u2009=\u20090.398).\nThe number of ICU admissions in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/ribavirin group was not significantly lower than the control group (0 versus 4, P\u2009=\u20090.109).\nThere was no difference in the number of deaths between the groups (0 versus 3, P\u2009=\u20090.234).\nThe cumulative incidence of recovery was higher in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/ribavirin arm (Gray's P\u2009=\u20090.033).\nThis randomized trial was too small to make definitive conclusions.\nThere were trends in favour of the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/ribavirin arm for recovery and lower death rates.\nHowever, there was an imbalance in the baseline characteristics between the arms.\nLarger randomized trials should be conducted to investigate this treatment further.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.\nPublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British
