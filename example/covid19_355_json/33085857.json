{"doc_id": "33085857", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Efficacy of Tocilizumab in Patients Hospitalized with Covid-19.\nThe efficacy of interleukin-6 receptor blockade in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) who are not receiving mechanical ventilation is unclear.\nWe performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, hyperinflammatory states, and at least two of the following signs: fever (body temperature >38\u00b0C), pulmonary infiltrates, or the need for supplemental oxygen in order to maintain an oxygen saturation greater than 92%.\nPatients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive standard care plus a single dose of either tocilizumab (8 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo.\nThe primary outcome was intubation or death, assessed in a time-to-event analysis.\nThe secondary efficacy outcomes were clinical worsening and discontinuation of supplemental oxygen among patients who had been receiving it at baseline, both assessed in time-to-event analyses.\nWe enrolled 243 patients; 141 (58%) were men, and 102 (42%) were women.\nThe median age was 59.8 years (range, 21.7 to 85.4), and 45% of the patients were Hispanic or Latino.\nThe hazard ratio for intubation or death in the tocilizumab group as compared with the placebo group was 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38 to 1.81; P\u2009=\u20090.64), and the hazard ratio for disease worsening was 1.11 (95% CI, 0.59 to 2.10; P\u2009=\u20090.73).\nAt 14 days, 18.0% of the patients in the tocilizumab group and 14.9% of the patients in the placebo group had had worsening of disease.\nThe median time to discontinuation of supplemental oxygen was 5.0 days (95% CI, 3.8 to 7.6) in the tocilizumab group and 4.9 days (95% CI, 3.8 to 7.8) in the placebo group (P\u2009=\u20090.69).\nAt 14 days, 24.6% of the patients in the tocilizumab group and 21.2% of the patients in the placebo group were still receiving supplemental oxygen.\nPatients who received tocilizumab had fewer serious infections than patients who received placebo.\nTocilizumab was not effective for preventing intubation or death in moderately ill hospitalized patients with Covid-19.\nSome benefit or harm cannot be ruled out, however, because the confidence intervals for efficacy comparisons were wide.
