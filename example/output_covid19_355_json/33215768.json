professionals facing the COVID-19 pandemic: A randomized clinical trial.\nDevice-related pressure injury (DRPI) is a serious problem that is affecting professionals working on the front lines against COVID-19 due to the prolonged use of personal protective equipment (PPE).\nIn addition to the physical and psychological integrity of professionals, these injuries can compromise the quality of care.\nTherefore, using technologies to prevent this adverse effect is an urgent matter.\nThis is a parallel two-arm randomized clinical trial without the use of a control group to compare the use of foam and extra-thin hydrocolloid in preventing DRPI associated with the use of PPE by health professionals working on the front lines against coronavirus.\nIn total, 88 professionals were divided into two groups: foam and hydrocolloid.\nData were collected using two instruments and related to demographic and professional characteristics and skin evaluation.\nEach volunteer received one of the dressings, both with the same dimensions and arranged over similar regions, and data were gathered at baseline and after 6 or 12\u2009hours.\nDescriptive and inferential analytic statistical methods were used; the significance level adopted was 5%.\nNo participant developed DRPI, but four areas with hyperemia were observed in the foam group (two in the forehead, one in the cheeks, and one in the nose bridge), as well as four areas with hyperemia in the hydrocolloid group (two in the nose bridge, one in the right ear, and one in the left ear).\nThere was no difference between the groups regarding skin conditions and discomfort (P >\u2009.05).\nThe average cost obtained was $ 5.8/person and $ 4.4/person in the foam group and the hydrocolloid group, respectively, considering the dressing measurements.\nThe results show that foam and extra-thin hydrocolloid were effective in preventing DRPI associated with the use of PPE.\n\u00a9 2020 by the Wound Healing Society.\n",
