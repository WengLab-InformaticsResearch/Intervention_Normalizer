{"doc_id": "33087178", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Efficacy of an online cognitive behavioral therapy program developed for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: the REduction of STress (REST) study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.\nThe acknowledgment of the mental health toll of the COVID-19 epidemic in healthcare workers has increased considerably as the disease evolved into a pandemic status.\nIndeed, high prevalence rates of depression, sleep disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been reported in Chinese healthcare workers during the epidemic peak.\nSymptoms of psychological distress are expected to be long-lasting and have a systemic impact on healthcare systems, warranting the need for evidence-based psychological treatments aiming at relieving immediate stress and preventing the onset of psychological disorders in this population.\nIn the current COVID-19 context, internet-based interventions have the potential to circumvent the pitfalls of face-to-face formats and provide the flexibility required to facilitate accessibility to healthcare workers.\nOnline cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in particular has proved to be effective in treating and preventing a number of stress-related disorders in populations other than healthcare workers.\nThe aim of our randomized controlled trial study protocol is to evaluate the efficacy of the 'My Health too' CBT program-a program we have developed for healthcare workers facing the pandemic-on immediate perceived stress and on the emergence of psychiatric disorders at 3- and 6-month follow-up compared to an active control group (i.e., bibliotherapy).\nPowered for superiority testing, this six-site open trial involves the random assignment of 120 healthcare workers with stress levels >\u200916 on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) to either the 7-session online CBT program or bibliotherapy.\nThe primary outcome is the decrease of PSS-10 scores at 8\u2009weeks.\nSecondary outcomes include depression, insomnia, and PTSD symptoms; self-reported resilience and rumination; and credibility and satisfaction.\nAssessments are scheduled at pretreatment, mid-treatment (at 4\u2009weeks), end of active treatment (at 8\u2009weeks), and at 3-month and 6-month follow-up.\nThis is the first study assessing the efficacy and the acceptability of a brief online CBT program specifically developed for healthcare workers.\nGiven the potential short- and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers' mental health, but also on healthcare systems, our findings can significantly impact clinical practice and management of the ongoing, and probably long-lasting, health crisis.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION :
