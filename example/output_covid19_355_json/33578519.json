{"doc_id": "33578519", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "The effect of a micro-visual intervention on the accelerated recovery of patients with kinesiophobia after total knee replacement during neo-coronary pneumonia.\nThe global neo-coronary pneumonia epidemic has increased the workload of healthcare institutions in various countries and directly affected the physical and psychological recovery of the vast majority of patients requiring hospitalization in China.\nWe anticipate that post-total knee arthroplasty kinesiophobia may have an impact on patients' postoperative pain scores, knee function, and ability to care for themselves in daily life.\nThe purpose of this study is to conduct a micro-video intervention via WeChat to verify the impact of this method on the rapid recovery of patients with kinesiophobia after total knee arthroplasty during neo-coronary pneumonia.\nUsing convenience sampling method, 78 patients with kinesiophobia after artificial total knee arthroplasty who met the exclusion criteria were selected and randomly grouped, with the control group receiving routine off-line instruction and the intervention group receiving micro-video intervention, and the changes in the relevant indexes of the two groups of patients at different time points on postoperative day 1, 3 and 7 were recorded and analyzed.\nThere were no statistical differences in the scores of kinesiophobia, pain, knee flexion mobility (ROM) and ability to take care of daily life between the two groups on the first postoperative day (P\u200a>\u200a.05).\nOn postoperative day 3 and 7, there were statistical differences in Tampa Scale for kinesiophobia, pain, activities of daily living scale score and ROM between the two groups (P\u200a<\u200a.01), and\nthe first time of getting out of bed between the two groups (P\u200a<\u200a.05), and by repeated-measures ANOVA, there were statistically significant time points, groups and interaction effects of the outcome indicators between the 2 groups (P\u200a<\u200a.01), indicating that the intervention group reconstructed the patients' postoperative kinesiophobiaand hyperactivity.\nThe level of pain awareness facilitates the patient's acquisition of the correct functional exercises to make them change their misbehavior.\nWeChat micro-video can reduce the fear of movement score and pain score in patients with kinesiophobia after unilateral total knee arthroplasty, shorten the first time out of bed, and improve their joint mobility and daily living ability.\nThis study has passed the ethical review of the hospital where it was conducted and has been filed, Ethics Approval Number: 20181203-01.\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 the Author(s).\nPublished by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.\n", "Evidence
