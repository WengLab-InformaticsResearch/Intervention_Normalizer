coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein acquired a D614G mutation early in the pandemic that confers greater infectivity and is now the globally dominant form.\nTo determine whether D614G might also mediate neutralization escape that could compromise vaccine efficacy, sera from spike-immunized mice, nonhuman primates, and humans were evaluated for neutralization of pseudoviruses bearing either D614 or G614 spike.\nIn all cases, the G614 pseudovirus was moderately more susceptible to neutralization.\nThe G614 pseudovirus also was more susceptible to neutralization by receptor-binding domain (RBD) monoclonal antibodies and convalescent sera from people infected with either form of the virus.\nNegative stain electron microscopy revealed a higher percentage of the 1-RBD \"up\" conformation in the G614 spike, suggesting increased epitope exposure as a mechanism of enhanced vulnerability to neutralization.\nBased on these findings, the D614G mutation is not expected to be an obstacle for current vaccine development.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020.\nPublished by Elsevier Inc.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "pseudoviruses", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 210, "end":
