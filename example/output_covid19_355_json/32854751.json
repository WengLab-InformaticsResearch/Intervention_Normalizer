{"doc_id": "32854751", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Hydroxychloroquine for post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 among naval personnel in Sri Lanka: study protocol for a randomized, controlled trial.\nThe first case of a coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection in a Sri Lankan was reported on March 11, 2020.\nThe situation in Sri Lanka changed with the rapid increase of personnel contracting COVID-19 in a naval base camp that housed more than 4000 people.\nThis provided a unique opportunity to study the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), while taking stringent, non-pharmacologic, public health measures to prevent spread.\nOur aim is to study the effectiveness and safety of HCQ for PEP among naval personnel with exposure to COVID-19-positive patients.\nMETHODS/DESIGN : This is a placebo-controlled, randomized, clinical trial carried out in the naval base camp and quarantine centers of the Sri Lanka Navy, Ministry of Defense, Sri Lanka.\nNavy personnel who are exposed to a patient with confirmed COVID-19 infection but test negative for the virus on reverse real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) at recruitment will be randomized, 200 to each arm, to receive HCQ or placebo and monitored for the development of symptoms or rRT-PCR positivity for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus for 14\u2009days.\nThis trial will provide high-quality evidence of the effectiveness and safety of HCQ as PEP for COVID-19.\nThe study design is unique due to the circumstances of the outbreak in a confined area among otherwise healthy adults, at a relatively early stage of its spread.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : Sri Lanka Clinical Trials Registry (SLCTR) SLCTR/2020/011 .\nRegistered
