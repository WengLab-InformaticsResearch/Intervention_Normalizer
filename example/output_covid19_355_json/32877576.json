{"doc_id": "32877576", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Phase 1-2 Trial of a SARS-CoV-2 Recombinant Spike Protein Nanoparticle Vaccine.\nNVX-CoV2373 is a recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (rSARS-CoV-2) nanoparticle vaccine composed of trimeric full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins and Matrix-M1 adjuvant.\nWe initiated a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1-2 trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the rSARS-CoV-2 vaccine (in 5-\u03bcg and 25-\u03bcg doses, with or without Matrix-M1 adjuvant, and with observers unaware of trial-group assignments) in 131 healthy adults.\nIn phase 1, vaccination comprised two intramuscular injections, 21 days apart.\nThe primary outcomes were reactogenicity; laboratory values (serum chemistry and hematology), according to Food and Drug Administration toxicity scoring, to assess safety; and IgG anti-spike protein response (in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] units).\nSecondary outcomes included unsolicited adverse events, wild-type virus neutralization (microneutralization assay), and T-cell responses (cytokine staining).\nIgG and microneutralization assay results were compared with 32 (IgG) and 29 (neutralization) convalescent serum samples from patients with Covid-19, most of whom were symptomatic.\nWe performed a primary analysis at day 35.\nAfter randomization, 83 participants were assigned to receive the vaccine with adjuvant and 25 without adjuvant, and 23 participants were assigned to receive placebo.\nNo serious adverse events were noted.\nReactogenicity was absent or mild in the majority of participants, more common with adjuvant, and of short duration (mean, \u22642 days).\nOne participant had mild fever that lasted 1 day.\nUnsolicited adverse events were mild in most participants; there were no severe adverse events.\nThe addition of adjuvant resulted in enhanced immune responses, was antigen dose-sparing, and induced a T helper 1 (Th1) response.\nThe two-dose 5-\u03bcg adjuvanted regimen induced geometric mean anti-spike IgG (63,160 ELISA units) and neutralization (3906) responses that exceeded geometric mean responses in convalescent serum from mostly symptomatic Covid-19 patients (8344 and 983, respectively).\nAt 35 days, NVX-CoV2373 appeared to be safe, and it elicited immune responses that exceeded levels in Covid-19 convalescent serum.\nThe Matrix-M1 adjuvant induced CD4+ T-cell responses that were biased toward a Th1 phenotype.\n(Funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations;
