{"doc_id": "32641091", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Efficacy of chloroquine versus lopinavir/ritonavir in mild/general COVID-19 infection: a prospective, open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled clinical study.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 (caused by SARS-Cov-2) is very serious, and no effective antiviral treatment has yet been confirmed.\nThe adage \"old drug, new trick\" in this context may suggest the important therapeutic potential of existing drugs.\nWe found that the lopinavir/ritonavir treatment recommended in the fifth edition of the Treatment Plan of China can only help to improve a minority of throat-swab nucleic-acid results (3/15) in hospitals.\nOur previous use of chloroquine to treat patients with COVID-19 infection showed an improvement in more throat-swab nucleic-acid results (5/10) than the use of lopinavir/ritonavir.\nMETHODS/DESIGN : This is a prospective, open-label, randomized controlled, multicenter clinical study.\nThe study consists of three phases: a screening period, a treatment period of no more than 10\u2009days, and a follow-up period for each participant.\nParticipants with COVID-19 infection who are eligible for selection for the study will be randomly allocated to the trial group or the control group.\nThe control group will be given lopinavir/ritonavir treatment for no more than 10\u2009days.\nThe trial group will be given chloroquine phosphate treatment for no more than 10\u2009days.\nThe primary outcome is the clinical recovery time at no more than 28\u2009days after the completion of therapy and follow-up.\nThe secondary outcomes include the rate of treatment success after the completion of therapy and follow-up, the time of treatment success after no more than 28\u2009days, the rate of serious adverse events during the completion of therapy and follow-up, and the time to return to normal temperature (calculated from the onset of illness) during the completion of therapy and follow-up.\nComparisons will be performed using two-sided tests with a statistical significance level of 5%.\nThis experiment should reveal the efficacy and safety of using chloroquine versus lopinavir/ritonavir for patients with mild/general COVID-19 infection.\nIf the new treatment including chloroquine shows a higher rate of throat-swab SARS-CoV-2 real-time fluorescent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negativity and is safe, it could be tested as a future COVID-19 treatment.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ID: ChiCTR2000029741
