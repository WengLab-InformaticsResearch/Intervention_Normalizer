the COVID-19 pandemic and related social restrictions negatively affect lifestyle behaviours and mental health in general populations.\nTo study the longitudinal impact of COVID-19 on work practices, lifestyle and well-being among desk workers during shelter-at-home restrictions.\nWe added follow-up after completion of a clinical trial among desk workers to longitudinally measure sedentary behaviour, physical activity, sleep, diet, mood, quality of life and work-related health using validated questionnaires and surveys.\nWe compared outcomes assessed before and during COVID-19 shelter-at-home restrictions.\nWe assessed whether changes in outcomes differed by remote working status (always, changed to or never remote) using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).\nParticipants (N = 112; 69% female; mean (SD) age = 45.4 (12.3) years; follow-up = 13.5 (6.8) months) had substantial changes to work practices, including 72% changing to remote work.\nDeleterious changes from before to during shelter-at-home included: 1.3 (3.5)-h increase in non-workday sedentary behaviour; 0.7 (2.8)-point worsening of sleep quality; 8.5 (21.2)-point increase in mood disturbance; reductions in five of eight quality of life subscales; 0.5 (1.1)-point decrease in work-related health (P < 0.05).\nOther outcomes, including diet, physical activity and workday sedentary behaviour, remained stable (P \u2265 0.05).\nWorkers who were remote before and during the pandemic had greater increases in non-workday sedentary behaviour and stress, with greater declines in physical functioning.\nWake time was delayed overall by 41 (61) min, and more so in workers who changed to remote.\nEmployers should consider supporting healthy lifestyle and well-being among desk workers during pandemic-related social restrictions, regardless of remote working status.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.\nPublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society of Occupational Medicine.\nAll rights reserved.\nFor
