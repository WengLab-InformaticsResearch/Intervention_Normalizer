{"doc_id": "32984892", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) levels in relation to risk factors for COVID-19 in two large cohorts of patients with atrial fibrillation.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus entering human cells using angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell surface receptor.\nACE2 is shed to the circulation, and a higher plasma level of soluble ACE2 (sACE2) might reflect a higher cellular expression of ACE2.\nThe present study explored the associations between sACE2 and clinical factors, cardiovascular biomarkers, and genetic variability.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS : Plasma and DNA samples were obtained from two international cohorts of elderly patients with atrial fibrillation (n = 3999 and n = 1088).\nThe sACE2 protein level was measured by the Olink Proteomics\u00ae Multiplex CVD II96\u2009\u00d7\u200996 panel.\nLevels of the biomarkers high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, D-dimer, and cystatin-C were determined by immunoassays.\nGenome-wide association studies were performed by Illumina chips.\nHigher levels of sACE2 were statistically significantly associated with male sex, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and older age.\nThe sACE2 level was most strongly associated with the levels of GDF-15, NT-proBNP, and hs-cTnT. When adjusting for these biomarkers, only male sex remained associated with sACE2.\nWe found no statistically significant genetic regulation of the sACE2 level.\nMale sex and clinical or biomarker indicators of biological ageing, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes are associated with higher sACE2 levels.\nThe levels of GDF-15 and NT-proBNP, which are associated both with the sACE2 level and a higher risk for mortality and cardiovascular disease, might contribute to better identification of risk for severe COVID-19 infection.\nPublished on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.\nAll
