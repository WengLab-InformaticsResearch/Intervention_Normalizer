{"doc_id": "33272319", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Helmet continuous positive airway pressure versus high-flow nasal cannula in COVID-19: a pragmatic randomised clinical trial (COVID HELMET).\nPatients with COVID-19 and hypoxaemia despite conventional low-flow oxygen therapy are often treated with high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in line with international guidelines.\nOxygen delivery by helmet continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a feasible option that enables a higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and may theoretically reduce the need for intubation compared to HFNC but direct comparative evidence is lacking.\nWe plan to perform an investigator-initiated, pragmatic, randomised trial at an intermediate-level COVID-19 cohort ward in Helsingborg Hospital, southern Sweden.\nWe have estimated a required sample size of 120 patients randomised 1:1 to HFNC or Helmet CPAP to achieve 90% power to detect superiority at a 0.05 significance level regarding the primary outcome of ventilator free days (VFD) within 28\u2009days using a Mann-Whitney U test.\nPatient recruitment is planned to being June 2020 and be completed in the first half of 2021.\nWe hypothesise that the use of Helmet CPAP will reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation compared to the use of HFNC without having a negative effect on survival.\nThis could have important implications during the current COVID-19 epidemic.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04395807 .\nRegistered on 20 May 2020.\n", "Evidence Map":
