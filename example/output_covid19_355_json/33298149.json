{"doc_id": "33298149", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "A randomized, open-label, adaptive, proof-of-concept clinical trial of modulation of host thromboinflammatory response in patients with COVID-19: the DAWn-Antico study.\nThe peak of the global COVID-19 pandemic has not yet been reached, and many countries face the prospect of a second wave of infections before effective vaccinations will be available.\nAfter an initial phase of viral replication, some patients develop a second illness phase in which the host thrombotic and inflammatory responses seem to drive complications.\nSevere COVID-19 disease is linked to high mortality, hyperinflammation, and a remarkably high incidence of thrombotic events.\nWe hypothesize a crucial pathophysiological role for the contact pathway of coagulation and the kallikrein-bradykinin pathway.\nTherefore, drugs that modulate this excessive thromboinflammatory response should be investigated in severe COVID-19.\nIn this adaptive, open-label multicenter randomized clinical trial, we compare low molecular weight heparins at 50\u2009IU anti-Xa/kg twice daily-or 75\u2009IU anti-Xa twice daily for intensive care (ICU) patients-in combination with aprotinin to standard thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\nIn the case of hyperinflammation, the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist anakinra will be added on top of the drugs in the interventional arm.\nIn a pilot phase, the effect of the intervention on thrombotic markers (D-dimer) will be assessed.\nIn the full trial, the primary outcome is defined as the effect of the interventional drugs on clinical status as defined by the WHO ordinal scale for clinical improvement.\nIn this trial, we target the thromboinflammatory response at multiple levels.\nWe intensify the dose of low molecular weight heparins to reduce thrombotic complications.\nAprotinin is a potent kallikrein pathway inhibitor that reduces fibrinolysis, activation of the contact pathway of coagulation, and local inflammatory response.\nAdditionally, aprotinin has shown in vitro inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry.\nBecause the excessive thromboinflammatory response is one of the most adverse prognostic factors in COVID-19, we will add anakinra, a recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, to the regimen in case of severely increased inflammatory parameters.\nThis way, we hope to modulate the systemic response to SARS-CoV-2 and avoid disease progressions with a potentially fatal outcome.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : The EU Clinical Trials Register
