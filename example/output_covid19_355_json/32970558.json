{"doc_id": "32970558", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Barrier Enclosure for Endotracheal Intubation in a Simulated COVID-19 Scenario: A Crossover Study.\nBarrier enclosures have been developed to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission to healthcare providers during intubation, but little is known about their impact on procedure performance.\nWe sought to determine whether a barrier enclosure delays time to successful intubation by experienced airway operators.\nWe conducted a crossover simulation study at a tertiary academic hospital.\nParticipants watched a four-minute video, practiced one simulated intubation with a barrier enclosure, and then completed one intubation with and one without the barrier enclosure (randomized to determine order).\nThe primary outcome measure was time from placement of the video laryngoscope at the lips to first delivered ventilation.\nSecondary outcomes were periprocedural complications and participant responses to a post-study survey.\nProceduralists (n = 50) from emergency medicine and anesthesiology had median intubation times of 23.6 seconds with practice barrier enclosure, 20.5 seconds with barrier enclosure, and 16.7 seconds with no barrier.\nIntubation with barrier enclosure averaged 4.5 seconds longer (95% confidence interval, 2.7-6.4, p < .001) than without, but was less than the predetermined clinical significance threshold of 10 seconds.\nThree complications occurred, all during the practice intubation.\nBarrier enclosure made intubation more challenging according to 48%, but 90% indicated they would consider using it in clinical practice.\nExperienced airway operators performed intubation using a barrier enclosure with minimal increased time to procedure completion in this uncomplicated airway model.\nGiven potential to reduce droplet spread, use of a barrier enclosure may be an acceptable adjunct to endotracheal intubation for those familiar with its use.\n", "Evidence Map":
