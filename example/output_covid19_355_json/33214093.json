{"doc_id": "33214093", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Evaluating the effects of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) on the management of severe COVID-19 cases: A randomized controlled trial.\nThe newly discovered coronavirus has turned into coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and it rages at an unprecedented rate.\nConsidering the findings of previous studies on the use of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) for treating severe H1N1 infection and the satisfying results for reducing viral load and mortality, this study aimed to investigate the potential usefulness of IVIg for the management of severe cases.\nIn this randomized controlled trial, 84 patients were included: 52 in the IVIg group and 32 in the control group.\nThe intervention group received IVIg at a dose of 400\u00a0mg/kg, IV, daily for three days.\nBoth groups received hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and supportive care.\nThe demographic data, mortality rate, the need for mechanical ventilation, length of stay in hospital and in Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and imaging findings were recorded and compared in terms of the mentioned factors.\nThe mean time from admission to IVIg initiation was 3.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.35\u00a0days.\nThere was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of mortality rate (P-value\u00a0=\u00a00.8) and the need for mechanical ventilation (P-value\u00a0=\u00a00.39).\nThe length of hospital stay was significantly lower for the control group than that of the intervention group (P-value\u00a0=\u00a00.003).\nThere was a significant positive relationship between the time from hospital admission to IVIg initiation and the length of stay in the hospital and ICU among the survivors (P-value\u00a0<\u00a00.001 and\u00a0=0.01, respectively).\nOur findings did not support the use of IVIg in combination with hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir in treatment of severe COVID-19 cases.\nCopyright \u00a9
