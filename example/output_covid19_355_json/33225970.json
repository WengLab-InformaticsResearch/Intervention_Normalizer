Capsules are to be administered orally with plain water.\nThe IP is to be taken with all other concomitant medicines prescribed by the treating physician/doctor.\nThe dose of each component in the IP is very safe to administer.\nThe investigational products are registered products with the Indian Government and have been used for more than 6 months in various health conditions but not for COVID-19.\nMAIN OUTCOMES : Primary Outcome: Efficacy of the herbal extracts in COVID 19 positive patients (in declining viral load: time-point: 4 days and early recovery) Secondary Outcomes: Efficacy of the herbal extracts as an immune-modulator - TH1, TH2, Th17, IL6, NK Cells and CD markers; Immunoglobulin IGG (Serum); Immunoglobulin IGM (Serum) - at 30 days.\nEfficacy of the investigational product in reducing sequela of the disease Safety analysis (Liver Function Test and Kidney Function Test) including serious allergic reaction of: rash, itching/swelling, severe dizziness, trouble breathing.\nAn alphanumeric coded set of IP/Placebo containers will be used.\nParticipants will be automatically randomized to two groups in the ratio 1:1.\nBLINDING (MASKING) : Participants, caregivers and investigators were blinded.\nNUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE) : A total of more than 60 and up to 75 patients were to be enrolled in the study into the two groups, considering drop-outs.\n72 were enrolled with 37 into the intervention group and 35 into the placebo group.\nTRIAL STATUS : Protocol number: CoviQuest-01 Protocol version number: 1.2 Protocol Date: 1st July 2020 The recruitment period is completed for the trial.\nDate of 1st patient enrolment was 11th Aug 2020 and the last patient was enrolled on 3rd of September 2020.\nThis is to state that it was a late submission from authors for publication of the protocol to the BMC, after enrolment in the study was over.\nLast Participant's last follow-up is scheduled on 5th October 2020 TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was prospectively registered with the CTRI (Clinical Trial Registry of India).\nRegistration number is CTRI/2020/07/026570 .\nRegistered on 14 July 2020 FULL PROTOCOL: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1).\nIn the interest in expediting dissemination of this material, the familiar formatting has been eliminated; this
