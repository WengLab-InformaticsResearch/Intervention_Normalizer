{"doc_id": "33232588", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "A Randomized Trial of Convalescent Plasma in Covid-19 Severe Pneumonia.\nConvalescent plasma is frequently administered to patients with Covid-19 and has been reported, largely on the basis of observational data, to improve clinical outcomes.\nMinimal data are available from adequately powered randomized, controlled trials.\nWe randomly assigned hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19 pneumonia in a 2:1 ratio to receive convalescent plasma or placebo.\nThe primary outcome was the patient's clinical status 30 days after the intervention, as measured on a six-point ordinal scale ranging from total recovery to death.\nA total of 228 patients were assigned to receive convalescent plasma and 105 to receive placebo.\nThe median time from the onset of symptoms to enrollment in the trial was 8 days (interquartile range, 5 to 10), and hypoxemia was the most frequent severity criterion for enrollment.\nThe infused convalescent plasma had a median titer of 1:3200 of total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (interquartile range, 1:800 to 1:3200).\nNo patients were lost to follow-up.\nAt day 30 day, no significant difference was noted between the convalescent plasma group and the placebo group in the distribution of clinical outcomes according to the ordinal scale (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 1.35; P\u2009=\u20090.46).\nOverall mortality was 10.96% in the convalescent plasma group and 11.43% in the placebo group, for a risk difference of -0.46 percentage points (95% CI, -7.8 to 6.8).\nTotal SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers tended to be higher in the convalescent plasma group at day 2 after the intervention.\nAdverse events and serious adverse events were similar in the two groups.\nNo significant differences were observed in clinical status or overall mortality between patients treated with convalescent plasma and those who received placebo.\n(PlasmAr
