{"doc_id": "33165621", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Effect of Hydroxychloroquine on Clinical Status at 14 Days in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19: A Randomized Clinical Trial.\nImportance : Data on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are needed.\nObjective : To determine whether hydroxychloroquine is an efficacious treatment for adults hospitalized with COVID-19.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants : This was a multicenter, blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial conducted at 34 hospitals in the US.\nAdults hospitalized with respiratory symptoms from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were enrolled between April 2 and June 19, 2020, with the last outcome assessment on July 17, 2020.\nThe planned sample size was 510 patients, with interim analyses planned after every 102 patients were enrolled.\nThe trial was stopped at the fourth interim analysis for futility with a sample size of 479 patients.\nInterventions : Patients were randomly assigned to hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice daily for 2 doses, then 200 mg twice daily for 8 doses) (n\u2009=\u2009242) or placebo (n\u2009=\u2009237).\nMain Outcomes and Measures : The primary outcome was clinical status 14 days after randomization as assessed with a 7-category ordinal scale ranging from 1 (death) to 7 (discharged from the hospital and able to perform normal activities).\nThe primary outcome was analyzed with a multivariable proportional odds model, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) greater than 1.0 indicating more favorable outcomes with hydroxychloroquine than placebo.\nThe trial included 12 secondary outcomes, including 28-day mortality.\nResults : Among 479 patients who were randomized (median age, 57 years; 44.3% female; 37.2% Hispanic/Latinx; 23.4% Black; 20.1% in the intensive care unit; 46.8% receiving supplemental oxygen without positive pressure; 11.5% receiving noninvasive ventilation or nasal high-flow oxygen; and 6.7% receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), 433 (90.4%) completed the primary outcome assessment at 14 days and the remainder had clinical status imputed.\nThe median duration of symptoms prior to randomization was 5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 3 to 7 days).\nClinical status on the ordinal outcome scale at 14 days did not significantly differ between the hydroxychloroquine and placebo groups (median [IQR] score, 6 [4-7] vs 6 [4-7]; aOR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.42]).\nNone of the 12 secondary outcomes were significantly different between groups.\nAt 28 days after randomization, 25 of 241 patients (10.4%) in the hydroxychloroquine group and 25 of 236 (10.6%) in the placebo group had died (absolute difference, -0.2% [95% CI, -5.7% to 5.3%]; aOR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.54 to 2.09]).\nConclusions and Relevance : Among adults hospitalized with respiratory illness from COVID-19, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, compared with placebo, did not significantly improve clinical status at day 14.\nThese findings do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 among hospitalized adults.\nTrial Registration : ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04332991.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "Hospitalized Patients", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 62,
