the 'mood as information' theory.\nTo extrapolate the 'mood as information' theory to the unique and ecologically relevant setting of the COVID-19 pandemic;\nthe specific aim was to inform health care providers of the impact of bringing the pandemic to salience during life satisfaction evaluations, assessing whether this 'prime' results in increased or decreased reports of satisfaction which are derived unconsciously.\nProspective Randomised Interventional Study.\nRenal Transplant Department in a tertiary centre in the United Kingdom.\n200 Renal transplant patients aged between 20 and 88 years.\nTelephone interviews were undertaken between 1st May, 2020 and 29th May, 2020, at the height of 'shielding' from COVID-19.\nParticipants were randomised into 2 groups, with 1 group receiving a simple 'priming question' regarding the COVID pandemic and the other group having no prior contact.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS : Individuals were then asked to rate their own overall lifetime happiness; desire to change; overall life satisfaction and momentary happiness on a scale of 1 to 10 for each measure.\nIndependent sample t-tests were used to compare results between the two groups, with a type 1 error rate below 5% considered statistically significant.\nParticipants' overall happiness with their life as a whole revealed that individuals who were primed with a question about COVID-19 reported increased overall happiness with their life compared to individuals who had not been primed (+0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.42 to 1.35, p = 0.0002).\nIn addition, participants in the primed group reported less desire to change their life when compared to the non-primed group (-1.35, 95% confidence interval -2.06 to -0.65, p = 0.0002).\nParticipants who were primed with the COVID-19 question also reported a higher overall satisfaction with their life than individuals who had not been primed (+1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 1.52, p = 0.0001).\nFinally, the participants who received the priming question demonstrated increased reported momentary happiness (+0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.03 to 1.24, p = 0.04).\nThe results demonstrated that bringing salience to the COVID-19 pandemic with a simple question leads to positive changes in both momentary happiness and other components of global life satisfaction, thereby extrapolating evidence for the application of the mood-as-information theory to more extreme life circumstances.\nGiven the importance of patient-reported evaluations, these findings have implications for how, when and where accurate and reproducible measurements of life satisfaction should be obtained.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "shielding", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 44, "end": 53},
