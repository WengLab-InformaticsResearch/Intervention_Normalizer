Clinical Trials.\nImportance : A vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is urgently needed.\nObjective : To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an investigational inactivated whole-virus COVID-19 vaccine in China.\nInterventions : In the phase 1 trial, 96 participants were assigned to 1 of the 3 dose groups (2.5, 5, and 10 \u03bcg/dose) and an aluminum hydroxide (alum) adjuvant-only group (n\u2009=\u200924 in each group), and received 3 intramuscular injections at days 0, 28, and 56.\nIn the phase 2 trial, 224 adults were randomized to 5 \u03bcg/dose in 2 schedule groups (injections on days 0 and 14 [n\u2009=\u200984] vs alum only [n\u2009=\u200928], and days 0 and 21 [n\u2009=\u200984] vs alum only [n\u2009=\u200928]).\nDesign, Setting, and Participants : Interim analysis of ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 clinical trials to assess an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine.\nThe trials were conducted in Henan Province, China, among 96 (phase 1) and 224 (phase 2) healthy adults aged between 18 and 59 years.\nStudy enrollment began on April 12, 2020.\nThe interim analysis was conducted on June 16, 2020, and updated on July 27, 2020.\nMain Outcomes and Measures : The primary safety outcome was the combined adverse reactions 7 days after each injection, and the primary immunogenicity outcome was neutralizing antibody response 14 days after the whole-course vaccination, which was measured by a 50% plaque reduction neutralization test against live severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\nResults : Among 320 patients who were randomized (mean age, 42.8 years; 200 women [62.5%]), all completed the trial up to 28 days after the whole-course vaccination.\nThe 7-day adverse reactions occurred in 3 (12.5%), 5 (20.8%), 4 (16.7%), and 6 (25.0%) patients in the alum only, low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively, in the phase 1 trial; and in 5 (6.0%) and 4 (14.3%) patients who received injections on days 0 and 14 for vaccine and alum only, and 16 (19.0%) and 5 (17.9%) patients who received injections on days 0 and 21 for vaccine and alum only, respectively, in the phase 2 trial.\nThe most common adverse reaction was injection site pain, followed by fever, which were mild and self-limiting; no serious adverse reactions were noted.\nThe geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibodies in the low-, medium-, and high-dose groups at day 14 after 3 injections were 316 (95% CI, 218-457), 206 (95% CI, 123-343), and 297 (95% CI, 208-424), respectively, in the phase 1 trial, and were 121 (95% CI, 95-154) and 247 (95% CI, 176-345) at day 14 after 2 injections in participants receiving vaccine on days 0 and 14 and on days 0 and 21, respectively, in the phase 2 trial.\nThere were no detectable antibody responses in all alum-only groups.\nConclusions and Relevance : In this interim report of the phase 1 and phase 2 trials of an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine, patients had a low rate of adverse reactions and demonstrated immunogenicity; the study is ongoing.\nEfficacy and longer-term adverse event assessment will require phase 3 trials.\nTrial Registration : Chinese Clinical Trial Registry Identifier: ChiCTR2000031809.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "adults", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 27,
