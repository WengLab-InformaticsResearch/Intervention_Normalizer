effective vaccine holds the greatest promise for resolving the COVID-19 pandemic, hesitancy to accept vaccines remains common.\nTo explore vaccine acceptance decisions, we conducted a national survey of 1,000 people from all US states in August of 2020 and a replication in December of 2020.\nUsing a 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 factorial experimental design, we estimated the impact of three factors: probability of 1) protection against COVID-19, 2) minor side effects, and 3) a serious adverse reactions.\nThe outcome was respondents' reported likelihood of receiving a vaccine for the coronavirus.\nProbability of vaccine efficacy (50%, 70%, or 90%) had the largest effect among the three factors.\nThe probability of minor side effects (50%, 75%, 90%) including fever and sore arm, did not significantly influence likelihood of receiving the vaccine.\nThe chances of a serious adverse reaction, such as temporary or permanent paralysis, had a small but significant effect.\nA serious adverse reaction rate of 1/100,000 was more likely to discourage vaccine use in comparison to rates of 1/million or 1/100 million.\nAll interactions between the factors were nonsignificant.\nA replication following the announcement that vaccines were 95% effective showed small, but significant increases in the likelihood of taking a vaccine.\nThe main effects and interactions in the model remained unchanged.\nExpected benefit was more influential in respondents' decision making than expected side effects.\nThe absence of interaction effects suggests that respondents consider the side effects and benefits independently.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [], "Comparison Results": [], "Study Arm 1 Results": [], "Study Arm 2 Results": [], "Hypothesis": []}, "Sentence-level
