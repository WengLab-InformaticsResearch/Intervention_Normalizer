patients: a triple-blinded randomized controlled trial.\nAlthough almost a year has passed since the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and promising reports of vaccines have been presented, we still have a long way until these measures are available for all.\nFurthermore, the most appropriate corticosteroid and dose in the treatment of COVID-19 have remained uncertain.\nWe conducted a study to assess the effectiveness of methylprednisolone treatment versus dexamethasone for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\nIn this prospective triple-blinded randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 86 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from August to November 2020, in Shiraz, Iran.\nThe patients were randomly allocated into two groups to receive either methylprednisolone (2\u2009mg/kg/day; intervention group) or dexamethasone (6\u2009mg/kg/day; control group).\nData were assessed based on a 9-point WHO ordinal scale extending from uninfected (point 0) to death (point 8).\nThere were no significant differences between the groups on admission.\nHowever, the intervention group demonstrated significantly better clinical status compared to the control group at day 5 (4.02 vs. 5.21, p\u2009=\u20090.002) and day 10 (2.90 vs. 4.71, p\u2009=\u20090.001) of admission.\nThere was also a significant difference in the overall mean score between the intervention group and the control group, (3.909 vs. 4.873 respectively, p\u00a0=\u20090.004).\nThe mean length of hospital stay was 7.43\u2009\u00b1\u20093.64 and 10.52\u2009\u00b1\u20095.47\u2009days in the intervention and control groups, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.015).\nThe need for a ventilator was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (18.2% vs 38.1% p\u2009=\u20090.040).\nIn hospitalized hypoxic COVID-19 patients, methylprednisolone demonstrated better results compared to dexamethasone.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : The trial was registered with IRCT.IR
