                   Background:\n                     Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection is associated with strong infectiousness and has no effective therapy.\nWe aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of Mycobacterium vaccae nebulization in the treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n                        Methods:\n                     In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we included 31 adult patients with moderate COVID-19 who were admitted to the Fourth People's Hospital of Nanning (Nanning, China) between January 22, 2020 and February 17, 2020.\nPatients were randomly divided into two groups: group A (standard care group) and group B (M. vaccae in combination with standard care group).\nThe primary outcome was the time interval from admission to viral RNA negative conversion (oropharyngeal swabs were used in this study).\nSecondary outcomes included chest computed tomography (CT), mortality, length of hospital stay, complications during treatment, and so on.\nPatients were followed up to 4 weeks after discharge (reexamination of viral RNA, chest CT, etc.).\n                        Results:\n                     Nucleic acid test negative conversion time in group B was shorter than that in group A (2.9 days [2.7-8.7] vs. 6.8 days [3.3-13.8]; p\u2009=\u20090.045).\nNo death and no conversion to severe or critical cases were observed in both groups.\nTwo weeks after discharge, neither \"relapse\" nor \"return to positive\" cases were found.\nFour weeks after discharge, it was found that there was no case of \" relapse \" or \"return to positive\" in group B, and 1 patient in group A showed \"return to positive\", but there was no clinical manifestation and imaging progression.\nNo adverse reactions related to M. vaccae were found during observation period.\n                        Conclusion:\n                    M. vaccae treatment might shorten the time interval from admission to viral RNA negative conversion, which might be beneficial to the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.\n                        Clinical Trial Registration:\n
