{"doc_id": "33818472", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Chloroquine nasal drops in asymptomatic & mild COVID-19: An exploratory randomized clinical trial.\nBackground & objectives : Chloroquine (CQN) administered as nasal drops has the potential to achieve much greater local tissue levels than with oral/systemic administration.\nThis trial was undertaken to study the efficacy and safety profile of topical nasal administration of CQN drops in reducing viral load and preventing clinical progression in early COVID-19 infection.\nMethods : This randomized clinical trial was done with a sample size of 60.\nReverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed asymptomatic patients or those with mild COVID-19 illness [National Early Warning Score (NEWS) \u22644] were included.\nPatients were randomized in a 1:1 manner.\nControl arm (standard supportive treatment, n=30) was compared with intervention arm (n=30) of standard treatment plus CQN eye drops (0.03%) repurposed as nasal drops administered six times daily (0.5 ml/dose) for 10 days.\nOutcome measures were adverse events and adherence; clinical progression and outcomes were measured by NEWS; sequential RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values were also noted on days 0, 3, 7 and 10.\nResults : Nasal CQN was associated with local irritation in seven and non-compliance in one of 30 patients.\nEleven patients were excluded due to enrolment error (2 - recovered; 9 - false-positive referral), and 49 patients were analyzed as per modified intention-to-treat analysis.\nClinical recovery was noted as similar with 100 per cent asymptomatic by day seven in both arms.\nVirological outcomes also indicated similarly improving Ct values in both arms, and similar proportion of patients transitioning to non-infectivity by day 10 (controls - 19/25; nasal CQN - 15/24).\nNine false-positive patients with enrolment error and day 0 RT-PCR negative were initially uninfected but had continuing COVID-19 exposure and treatment as per randomization.\nPatients receiving nasal CQN (n=5) demonstrated stable Ct values from day 0 to 10, while patients with no nasal CQN (n=4) demonstrated significant dip in Ct value indicating to infection (Ct<35) and infectivity (Ct<33).\nInterpretation & conclusions : The present study suggests to the potential of topical nasal CQN in the prevention of COVID-19 infection if administered before the infection is established.\nNo significant differences in clinical or virological outcome were however, demonstrated in patients with mild but established illness.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "asymptomatic & mild COVID-19", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 27, "end": 55}, {"term": "early COVID-19
