{"doc_id": "33662102", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Effect of Ivermectin on Time to Resolution of Symptoms Among Adults With Mild COVID-19: A Randomized Clinical Trial.\nImportance : Ivermectin is widely prescribed as a potential treatment for COVID-19 despite uncertainty about its clinical benefit.\nObjective : To determine whether ivermectin is an efficacious treatment for mild COVID-19.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants : Double-blind, randomized trial conducted at a single site in Cali, Colombia.\nPotential study participants were identified by simple random sampling from the state's health department electronic database of patients with symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 during the study period.\nA total of 476 adult patients with mild disease and symptoms for 7 days or fewer (at home or hospitalized) were enrolled between July 15 and November 30, 2020, and followed up through December 21, 2020.\nIntervention : Patients were randomized to receive ivermectin, 300 \u03bcg/kg of body weight per day for 5 days (n\u2009=\u2009200) or placebo (n\u2009=\u2009200).\nMain Outcomes and Measures : Primary outcome was time to resolution of symptoms within a 21-day follow-up period.\nSolicited adverse events and serious adverse events were also collected.\nResults : Among 400 patients who were randomized in the primary analysis population (median age, 37 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 29-48]; 231 women [58%]), 398 (99.5%) completed the trial.\nThe median time to resolution of symptoms was 10 days (IQR, 9-13) in the ivermectin group compared with 12 days (IQR, 9-13) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for resolution of symptoms, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.32]; P\u2009=\u2009.53 by log-rank test).\nBy day 21, 82% in the ivermectin group and 79% in the placebo group had resolved symptoms.\nThe most common solicited adverse event was headache, reported by 104 patients (52%) given ivermectin and 111 (56%) who received placebo.\nThe most common serious adverse event was multiorgan failure, occurring in 4 patients (2 in each group).\nConclusion and Relevance : Among adults with mild COVID-19, a 5-day course of ivermectin, compared with placebo, did not significantly improve the time to resolution of symptoms.\nThe findings do not support the use of ivermectin for treatment of mild COVID-19, although larger trials may be needed to understand the effects of ivermectin on other clinically relevant outcomes.\nTrial Registration : ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04405843.\n", "Evidence Map":
