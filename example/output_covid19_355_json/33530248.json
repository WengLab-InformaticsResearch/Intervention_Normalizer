predicting the prognosis of severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.\nWe retrospectively analyzed patients with severe COVID-19 who were admitted from February 10, 2020 to April 5, 2020.\nFirst, all patients were randomly assigned to a training cohort or a validation cohort.\nBy univariate analysis of the training cohort, we developed combination scores and screened the superior score for predicting the prognosis.\nSubsequently, we identified the independent factors influencing prognosis.\nFinally, we demonstrated the predictive efficiency of the score in validation cohort.\nA total of 145 patients were enrolled.\nIn the training cohort, nonsurvivors had higher levels of lactic dehydrogenase than survivors.\nAmong the 7 combination scores that were developed, lactic dehydrogenase-lymphocyte ratio (LLR) had the highest area under the curve (AUC) value for predicting prognosis, and it was associated with the incidence of liver injury, renal injury, and higher disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) score on admission.\nUnivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that C-reactive protein, DIC score \u22652 and LLR >345 were the factors associated with prognosis.\nMultivariate analysis showed that only LLR >345 was an independent risk factor for prognosis (odds ratio [OR] = 9.176, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.674-31.487, P\u200a<\u200a.001).\nLastly, we confirmed that LLR was also an independent risk factor for prognosis in severe COVID-19 patients in the validation cohort where the AUC was 0.857 (95% CI: 0.718-0.997).LLR is an accurate predictive score for poor prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients.\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 the Author(s).\nPublished by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.\n", "Evidence Map":
