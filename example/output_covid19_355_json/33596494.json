{"doc_id": "33596494", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Randomized placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial on the efficacy of ayurvedic treatment regime on COVID-19 positive patients.\nSpecific treatment for COVID-19 is still an unmet need.\nOutcomes of clinical trials on repurposed drugs have not been yielding success.\nTherefore, it is necessary to include complementary approaches of medicine against COVID-19.\nThis study was designed to evaluate the impact of traditional Indian Ayurvedic treatment regime on asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 infection.\nSTUDY DESIGN :\nIt is a placebo controlled randomized double-blind pilot clinical trial.\nThe study was registered with Clinical Trial Registry-India (vide Registration No. CTRI/2020/05/025273) and conducted at the Department of Medicine in National Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Jaipur, India.\n1 g of Giloy Ghanvati (Tinospora cordifolia) and 2 g of Swasari Ras (traditional herbo-mineral formulation) and 0.5 g each of Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) and Tulsi Ghanvati (Ocimum sanctum) were given orally to the patients in treatment group twice per day for 7 days.\nMedicines were given in the form of tablets and each tablet weighed 500 mg.\nWhile, Swasari Ras was administered in powdered form, 30 min before breakfasts and dinners, rest were scheduled for 30 min post-meals.\nPatients in the treatment group also received 4 drops of Anu taila (traditional nasal drop) in each nostril every day 1 h before breakfast.\nPatients in the placebo group received identical-looking tablets and drops, post randomization and double blinded assortments.\nRT-qPCR test was used for the detection of viral load in the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples of study participants during the study.\nChemiluminescent immunometric assay was used to quantify serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) on day 1 and day 7 of the study.\nBy day 3, 71.1\u00a0% and 50.0\u00a0% patients recovered in the treatment and placebo groups, respectively.\nTreatment group witnessed 100\u00a0% recovery by day 7, while it was 60.0\u00a0% in the placebo group.\nAverage fold changes in serum levels of hs-CRP, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in treatment group were respectively, 12.4, 2.5 and 20 times lesser than those in the placebo group at day 7.\nThere was 40\u00a0% absolute reduction in the risk of delayed recovery from infection in the treatment group.\nAyurvedic treatment can expedite virological clearance, help in faster recovery and concomitantly reduce the risk of viral dissemination.\nReduced inflammation markers suggested less severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the treatment group.\nMoreover, there was no adverse effect observed to be associated with this treatment.\nCopyright \u00a9 2021.\nPublished by Elsevier GmbH.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "COVID-19
