{"doc_id": "33704352", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Immunogenicity of the Ad26.COV2.S Vaccine for COVID-19.\nImportance : Control of the global COVID-19 pandemic will require the development and deployment of safe and effective vaccines.\nObjective : To evaluate the immunogenicity of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson) in humans, including the kinetics, magnitude, and phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific humoral and cellular immune responses.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants : Twenty-five participants were enrolled from July 29, 2020, to August 7, 2020, and the follow-up for this day 71 interim analysis was completed on October 3, 2020; follow-up to assess durability will continue for 2 years.\nThis study was conducted at a single clinical site in Boston, Massachusetts, as part of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial of Ad26.COV2.S.\nInterventions : Participants were randomized to receive 1 or 2 intramuscular injections with 5\u2009\u00d7\u20091010 viral particles or 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091011 viral particles of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine or placebo administered on day 1 and day 57 (5 participants in each group).\nMain Outcomes and Measures : Humoral immune responses included binding and neutralizing antibody responses at multiple time points following immunization.\nCellular immune responses included immunospot-based and intracellular cytokine staining assays to measure T-cell responses.\nResults : Twenty-five participants were randomized (median age, 42; age range, 22-52; 52% women, 44% male, 4% undifferentiated), and all completed the trial through the day 71 interim end point.\nBinding and neutralizing antibodies emerged rapidly by day 8 after initial immunization in 90% and 25% of vaccine recipients, respectively.\nBy day 57, binding and neutralizing antibodies were detected in 100% of vaccine recipients after a single immunization.\nOn day 71, the geometric mean titers of spike-specific binding antibodies were 2432 to 5729 and the geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibodies were 242 to 449 in the vaccinated groups.\nA variety of antibody subclasses, Fc receptor binding properties, and antiviral functions were induced.\nCD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses were induced.\nConclusion and Relevance : In this phase 1 study, a single immunization with Ad26.COV2.S induced rapid binding and neutralization antibody responses as well as cellular immune responses.\nTwo phase 3 clinical trials are currently underway to determine the efficacy of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine.\nTrial Registration : ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04436276.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "COVID-19", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 46, "end": 54}], "Comparison Results": [], "Study Arm 1 Results": [], "Study Arm 2 Results": [], "Hypothesis": []}, "Sentence-level breakdown": [{"Section": "TITLE", "Text": "Immunogenicity of the Ad26.COV2.S Vaccine for COVID-19 .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "COVID-19", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 46, "end": 54}], "Intervention": [{"term": "Ad26.COV2.S Vaccine", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 22, "end": 41, "has_chemical": [{"text": "ad26.cov2.s vaccine", "maps_to": "C0042210:vaccine", "start": 0, "end": 19}], "has_relation": "N/A"}], "Outcome": [{"term": "Immunogenicity", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 0, "end": 14}], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "Importance : Control of the global COVID-19 pandemic will require the development and deployment of safe and effective vaccines .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "Objective : To evaluate the immunogenicity of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine ( Janssen / Johnson & Johnson ) in humans , including the kinetics , magnitude , and phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific humoral and cellular immune responses .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [{"term": "Ad26.COV2.S vaccine", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 50, "end": 69, "has_chemical": [{"text": "ad26.cov2.s vaccine", "maps_to": "C0042210:vaccine", "start": 0, "end": 19}], "has_relation": "N/A"}], "Outcome": [{"term": "immunogenicity", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 28, "end": 42}, {"term": "kinetics", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 128, "end": 136}, {"term": "magnitude", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 139, "end": 148}, {"term": "and", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 151, "end": 154}, {"term": "phenotype", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 155, "end": 164}, {"term": "SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 168, "end": 193}], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "UNKNOWN", "Text": "Design , Setting , and Participants : Twenty-five participants were enrolled from July 29 , 2020 , to August 7 , 2020 , and the follow-up for this day 71 interim analysis was completed on October 3 , 2020 ;
