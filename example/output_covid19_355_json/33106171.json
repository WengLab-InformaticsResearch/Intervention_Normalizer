{"doc_id": "33106171", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of Melatonin in moderately ill patients with COVID-19: A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.\nWe will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Melatonin, compared to the standard therapeutic regimen on clinical symptoms and serum inflammatory parameters in patients with confirmed COVID-19, who are moderately ill.\nTRIAL DESIGN : This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with a parallel-group design conducted at Shahid Mohammadi Hospital, Bandar Abbas, Iran.\nAll patients admitted to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Departments of Shahid Mohammadi Hospital, Bandar Abbas, Iran will be screened for the following criteria.\nINCLUSION CRITERIA : 1.\nAge \u226520 years 2.\nConfirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (positive polymerase chain reaction).\n3.\nModerate COVID-19 pneumonia (via computed tomography and or X-ray imaging), requiring hospitalization.\n4.\nHospitalized \u226448 hours.\n5.\nSigning informed consent and willingness of the participant to accept randomization to any assigned treatment arm.\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1.\nUnderlying diseases, including chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, seizure, depression, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and cholestatic liver diseases.\n2. Severe and critical COVID-19 pneumonia.\n3.\nUse of warfarin, corticosteroids, hormonal drugs, alcohol, other antiviral and investigational medicines, and illegal drugs (during the last 30 days).\n4.\nHistory of known allergy to Melatonin.\n5.\nPregnancy and breastfeeding.\nINTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR : Intervention group: The standard treatment regimen for COVID-19, according to the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education's protocol, along with Melatonin capsules at a dose of 50 mg daily for a period of seven days.\nCONTROL GROUP : The standard therapeutic regimen for COVID-19 along with Melatonin-like placebo capsules at a dose of one capsule daily for a period of seven days.\nBoth Melatonin and placebo capsules were prepared at the Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences, Bandar Abbas, Iran.\nMAIN OUTCOMES : The primary outcomes are the recovery rate of clinical symptoms and oxygen saturation as well as improvement of serum inflammatory parameters, including C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u0251), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and IL-6 within seven days of randomization.\nThe secondary outcomes are the time to improve clinical and paraclinical features along with the incidence of serious adverse drug reactions within seven days of randomization.\nIncluded patients will be allocated to one of the study arms using block randomization in a 1:1 ratio (each block consists of 10 patients).\nThis randomization method ensures a balanced allocation between the arms during the study.\nA web-based system will generate random numbers for the allocation sequence and concealment of participants.\nEach number relates to one of the study arms.\nBLINDING (MASKING) :\nAll study participants, clinicians, nurses, research coordinators, and those analyzing the data are blinded to the group assignment.\nNUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE) : A total of 60 patients randomized into two groups (30 in each group).\nTRIAL STATUS : The trial protocol is Version 1.0, August 14, 2020.\nRecruitment began August 22, 2020, and is anticipated to be completed by November 30, 2020.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : The trial protocol has been registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT).\nThe registration number is \" IRCT20200506047323N5 \".\nThe registration date was 14 August 2020.\nFULL PROTOCOL : The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1).\nIn the interest in expediting the dissemination of this material, the familiar formatting has been eliminated; this Letter serves as a summary of the key elements of the full protocol.\n", "Evidence
