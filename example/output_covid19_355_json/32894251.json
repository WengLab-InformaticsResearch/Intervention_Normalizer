agreement between remote and in-person outcome measures; and opinions of remote visits.\nWe enrolled 40 participants (mean (SD) age 64.3 (10.4), 29% women), and 38 (95%) completed all remote visits.\nThere was excellent correlation (ICC 0.81-0.87) between remote and in-person patient-reported outcomes, and moderate correlation (ICC 0.43-0.51) between remote and in-person motor assessments.\nOn average, remote visits took around one quarter of the time of in-person visits (54 vs 190 minutes).\nNearly all participants liked remote visits, and three-quarters said they would be more likely to participate in future trials if some visits could be conducted remotely.\nRemote visits are feasible and reliable in a phase III clinical trial of individuals with early, untreated Parkinson's disease.\nThese visits are shorter, reduce participant burden, and enable safe conduct of research visits, which is especially important in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "Parkinson 's disease", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 28, "end": 48}, {"term": "early , untreated Parkinson", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 90, "end": 117}], "Comparison Results": [], "Study Arm 1 Results": [], "Study Arm 2 Results": [], "Hypothesis": []}, "Sentence-level breakdown": [{"Section": "TITLE", "Text": "Feasibility , Reliability , and Value of Remote Video-Based Trial Visits in Parkinson 's Disease .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [{"term": "Remote Video-Based Trial", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 41, "end": 65, "has_relation": "N/A"}], "Outcome": [{"term": "Feasibility", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 0, "end": 11}, {"term": "Reliability", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 14, "end": 25}], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "BACKGROUND", "Text": "There is rising interest in remote clinical trial assessments , particularly in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "OBJECTIVE", "Text": "To demonstrate the feasibility , reliability , and value of remote visits in a phase III clinical trial of individuals with Parkinson 's disease .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [{"term": "remote visits", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 60, "end": 73, "has_relation": "N/A"}], "Outcome": [{"term": "feasibility", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 19, "end": 30}, {"term": "reliability", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 33, "end": 44}, {"term": "value", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 51, "end": 56}], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "METHODS", "Text": "We invited individuals with Parkinson 's disease enrolled in a phase III clinical trial ( STEADY-PD III ) to enroll in a sub-study of remote video-based visits .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "Parkinson 's disease", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 28, "end": 48}], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "METHODS", "Text": "Participants completed three remote visits over one year within four weeks of an in-person visit and completed assessments performed during the remote visit .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "METHODS", "Text": "We evaluated the ability to complete scheduled assessments remotely ;
