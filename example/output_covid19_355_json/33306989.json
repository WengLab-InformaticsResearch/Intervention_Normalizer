{"doc_id": "33306989", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Safety and efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) against SARS-CoV-2: an interim analysis of four randomised controlled trials in Brazil, South Africa, and the UK.\nA safe and efficacious vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), if deployed with high coverage, could contribute to the control of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe evaluated the safety and efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in a pooled interim analysis of four trials.\nThis analysis includes data from four ongoing blinded, randomised, controlled trials done across the UK, Brazil, and South Africa.\nParticipants aged 18 years and older were randomly assigned (1:1) to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine or control (meningococcal group A, C, W, and Y conjugate vaccine or saline).\nParticipants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group received two doses containing 5\u2008\u00d7\u20081010 viral particles (standard dose; SD/SD cohort); a subset in the UK trial received a half dose as their first dose (low dose) and a standard dose as their second dose (LD/SD cohort).\nThe primary efficacy analysis included symptomatic COVID-19 in seronegative participants with a nucleic acid amplification test-positive swab more than 14 days after a second dose of vaccine.\nParticipants were analysed according to treatment received, with data cutoff on Nov 4, 2020.\nVaccine efficacy was calculated as 1\u2008-\u2008relative risk derived from a robust Poisson regression model adjusted for age.\nStudies are registered at ISRCTN89951424 and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606, NCT04400838, and NCT04444674.\nBetween April 23 and Nov 4, 2020, 23\u2008848 participants were enrolled and 11\u2008636 participants (7548 in the UK, 4088 in Brazil) were included in the interim primary efficacy analysis.\nIn participants who received two standard doses, vaccine efficacy was 62\u00b71% (95% CI 41\u00b70-75\u00b77; 27 [0\u00b76%] of 4440 in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group vs71 [1\u00b76%] of 4455 in the control group) and in participants who received a low dose followed by a standard dose, efficacy was 90\u00b70% (67\u00b74-97\u00b70; three [0\u00b72%] of 1367 vs 30 [2\u00b72%] of 1374; pinteraction=0\u00b7010).\nOverall vaccine efficacy across both groups was 70\u00b74% (95\u00b78% CI 54\u00b78-80\u00b76; 30 [0\u00b75%] of 5807 vs 101 [1\u00b77%] of 5829).\nFrom 21 days after the first dose, there were ten cases hospitalised for COVID-19, all in the control arm; two were classified as severe COVID-19, including one death.\nThere were 74\u2008341 person-months of safety follow-up (median 3\u00b74 months, IQR 1\u00b73-4\u00b78): 175 severe adverse events occurred in 168 participants, 84 events in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 91 in the control group.\nThree events were classified as possibly related to a vaccine: one in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, one in the control group, and one in a participant who remains masked to group allocation.\nChAdOx1 nCoV-19 has an acceptable safety profile and has been found to be efficacious against symptomatic COVID-19 in this interim analysis of ongoing clinical trials.\nUK Research and Innovation, National Institutes for Health Research (NIHR), Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Lemann Foundation, Rede D'Or, Brava and Telles Foundation, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Thames Valley and South Midland's NIHR Clinical Research Network, and AstraZeneca.\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 The Author(s).\nPublished by Elsevier Ltd.
