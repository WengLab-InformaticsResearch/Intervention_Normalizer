{"doc_id": "33052809", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Effect of an Aerosol Box on Intubation in Simulated Emergency Department Airways: A Randomized Crossover Study.\nThe use of transparent plastic aerosol boxes as protective barriers during endotracheal intubation has been advocated during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic.\nThere is evidence of worldwide distribution of such devices, but some experts have warned of possible negative impacts of their use.\nThe objective of this study was to measure the effect of an aerosol box on intubation performance across a variety of simulated difficult airway scenarios in the emergency department.\nThis was a randomized, crossover design study.\nParticipants were randomized to intubate one of five airway scenarios with and without an aerosol box in place, with randomization of intubation sequence.\nThe primary outcome was time to intubation.\nSecondary outcomes included number of intubation attempts, Cormack-Lehane view, percent of glottic opening, and resident physician perception of intubation difficulty.\nForty-eight residents performed 96 intubations.\nTime to intubation was significantly longer with box use than without (mean 17 seconds [range 6-68 seconds] vs mean 10 seconds [range 5-40 seconds], p <0.001).\nParticipants perceived intubation as being significantly more difficult with the aerosol box.\nThere were no significant differences in the number of attempts or quality of view obtained.\nUse of an aerosol box during difficult endotracheal intubation increases the time to intubation and perceived difficulty across a range of simulated ED patients.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "Simulated Emergency Department Airways", "negation": "affirmed",
