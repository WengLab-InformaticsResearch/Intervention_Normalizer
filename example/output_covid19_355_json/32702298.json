{"doc_id": "32702298", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Safety and immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: a preliminary report of a phase 1/2, single-blind, randomised controlled trial.\nThe pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might be curtailed by vaccination.\nWe assessed the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a viral vectored coronavirus vaccine that expresses the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.\nWe did a phase 1/2, single-blind, randomised controlled trial in five trial sites in the UK of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein compared with a meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) as control.\nHealthy adults aged 18-55 years with no history of laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or of COVID-19-like symptoms were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 at a dose of 5\u2008\u00d7\u20081010 viral particles or MenACWY as a single intramuscular injection.\nA protocol amendment in two of the five sites allowed prophylactic paracetamol to be administered before vaccination.\nTen participants assigned to a non-randomised, unblinded ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost group received a two-dose schedule, with the booster vaccine administered 28 days after the first dose.\nHumoral responses at baseline and following vaccination were assessed using a standardised total IgG ELISA against trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a muliplexed immunoassay, three live SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assays (a 50% plaque reduction neutralisation assay [PRNT50]; a microneutralisation assay [MNA50, MNA80, and MNA90]; and Marburg VN), and a pseudovirus neutralisation assay.\nCellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo interferon-\u03b3 enzyme-linked immunospot assay.\nThe co-primary outcomes are to assess efficacy, as measured by cases of symptomatic virologically confirmed COVID-19, and safety, as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events.\nAnalyses were done by group allocation in participants who received the vaccine.\nSafety was assessed over 28 days after vaccination.\nHere, we report the preliminary findings on safety, reactogenicity, and cellular and humoral immune responses.\nThe study is ongoing, and was registered at ISRCTN, 15281137, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606.\nBetween April 23 and May 21, 2020, 1077 participants were enrolled and assigned to receive either ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (n=543) or MenACWY (n=534), ten of whom were enrolled in the non-randomised ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost group.\nLocal and systemic reactions were more common in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and many were reduced by use of prophylactic paracetamol, including pain, feeling feverish, chills, muscle ache, headache, and malaise (all p<0\u00b705).\nThere were no serious adverse events related to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.\nIn the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, spike-specific T-cell responses peaked on day 14 (median 856 spot-forming cells per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells, IQR 493-1802; n=43).\nAnti-spike IgG responses rose by day 28 (median 157 ELISA units [EU], 96-317; n=127), and were boosted following a second dose (639 EU, 360-792; n=10).\nNeutralising antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 32 (91%) of 35 participants after a single dose when measured in MNA80 and in 35 (100%) participants when measured in PRNT50.\nAfter a booster dose, all participants had neutralising activity (nine of nine in MNA80 at day 42 and ten of ten in Marburg VN on day 56).\nNeutralising antibody responses correlated strongly with antibody levels measured by ELISA (R2=0\u00b767 by Marburg VN; p<0\u00b7001).\nChAdOx1 nCoV-19 showed an acceptable safety profile, and homologous boosting increased antibody responses.\nThese results, together with the induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses, support large-scale evaluation of this candidate vaccine in an ongoing phase 3 programme.\nUK Research and Innovation, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Thames Valley and South Midland's NIHR Clinical Research Network, and the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Partner site Gie\u00dfen-Marburg-Langen.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 The Author(s).\nPublished by Elsevier Ltd.
