{"doc_id": "33434451", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Videoconference Intervention for Distance Caregivers of Patients With Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial.\nApproximately 20% of caregivers (CGs) live > 1 hour away from the patient and are considered distance caregivers (DCGs) who often report higher distress and anxiety than local CGs.\nThe purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of an intervention aimed at reducing anxiety and distress in DCGs of patients with cancer.\nThis randomized controlled trial enrolled DCGs of patients with all cancer types who were being seen monthly by oncologists in outpatient clinics.\nThere were three arms of the intervention delivered over a 4-month period: arm 1 (a) received 4 monthly videoconference-tailored coaching sessions with an advanced practice nurse or social worker focused on information and support, (b) participated in patient's appointments with the oncologist via videoconference over the 4-month study period, and (c) had access to a website designed for DCGs.\nArm 2 did not receive the coaching sessions but received the other two components, and arm 3 received access to the DCG website only.\nThere were 302 DCGs who provided pre- and postintervention data.\nThere were significant anxiety by group (P = .028 and r = 0.16) and distress by group interactions (P = .014 and r = 0.17).\nArm 1 had the greatest percentage of DCGs who demonstrated improvement in anxiety (18.6%) and distress (25.2%).\nCoaching and use of videoconference technology (to join the DCG into the patient-oncologist office visit) were effective in reducing both anxiety and distress for DCGs.\nThese components could be considered for local CGs who-with COVID-19-are unable to accompany the patient to oncologist visits.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "Distance Caregivers of Patients", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 33, "end": 64}, {"term": "Cancer", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS":
