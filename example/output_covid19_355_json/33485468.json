{"doc_id": "33485468", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBV152: a double-blind, randomised, phase 1 trial.\nTo mitigate the effects of COVID-19, a vaccine is urgently needed.\nBBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine formulated with a toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule adsorbed to alum (Algel-IMDG) or alum (Algel).\nWe did a double-blind, multicentre, randomised, controlled phase 1 trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of BBV152 at 11 hospitals across India.\nHealthy adults aged 18-55 years who were deemed healthy by the investigator were eligible.\nIndividuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and/or serology tests were excluded.\nParticipants were randomly assigned to receive either one of three vaccine formulations (3 \u03bcg with Algel-IMDG, 6 \u03bcg with Algel-IMDG, or 6 \u03bcg with Algel) or an Algel only control vaccine group.\nBlock randomisation was done with a web response platform.\nParticipants and investigators were masked to treatment group allocation.\nTwo intramuscular doses of vaccines were administered on day 0 (the day of randomisation) and day 14.\nPrimary outcomes were solicited local and systemic reactogenicity events at 2 h and 7 days after vaccination and throughout the full study duration, including serious adverse events.\nSecondary outcome was seroconversion (at least four-fold increase from baseline) based on wild-type virus neutralisation.\nCell-mediated responses were evaluated by intracellular staining and ELISpot.\nThe trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04471519).\nBetween July 13 and 30, 2020, 827 participants were screened, of whom 375 were enrolled.\nAmong the enrolled participants, 100 each were randomly assigned to the three vaccine groups, and 75 were randomly assigned to the control group (Algel only).\nAfter both doses, solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were reported by 17 (17%; 95% CI 10\u00b75-26\u00b71) participants in the 3 \u03bcg with Algel-IMDG group, 21 (21%; 13\u00b78-30\u00b75) in the 6 \u03bcg with Algel-IMDG group, 14 (14%; 8\u00b71-22\u00b77) in the 6 \u03bcg with Algel group, and ten (10%; 6\u00b79-23\u00b76) in the Algel-only group.\nThe most common solicited adverse events were injection site pain (17 [5%] of 375 participants), headache (13 [3%]), fatigue (11 [3%]), fever (nine [2%]), and nausea or vomiting (seven [2%]).\nAll solicited adverse events were mild (43 [69%] of 62) or moderate (19 [31%]) and were more frequent after the first dose.\nOne serious adverse event of viral pneumonitis was reported in the 6 \u03bcg with Algel group, unrelated to the vaccine.\nSeroconversion rates (%) were 87\u00b79, 91\u00b79, and 82\u00b78 in the 3 \u03bcg with Algel-IMDG, 6 \u03bcg with Algel-IMDG, and 6 \u03bcg with Algel groups, respectively.\nCD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses were detected in a subset of 16 participants from both Algel-IMDG groups.\nBBV152 led to tolerable safety outcomes and enhanced immune responses.\nBoth Algel-IMDG formulations were selected for phase 2 immunogenicity trials.\nFurther efficacy trials are warranted.\nBharat Biotech International.\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
