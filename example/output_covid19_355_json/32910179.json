{"doc_id": "32910179", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Effect of Recombinant Human Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor for Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Lymphopenia: A Randomized Clinical Trial.\nImportance : Lymphopenia is common and correlates with poor clinical outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nObjective : To determine whether a therapy that increases peripheral blood leukocyte and lymphocyte cell counts leads to clinical improvement in patients with COVID-19.\nDesign, Setting and Participants : Between February 18 and April 10, 2020, we conducted an open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial at 3 participating centers in China.\nThe main eligibility criteria were pneumonia, a blood lymphocyte cell count of 800 per \u03bcL (to convert to \u00d7109/L, multiply by 0.001) or lower, and no comorbidities.\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was confirmed with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing.\nExposures : Usual care alone, or usual care plus 3 doses of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF, 5 \u03bcg/kg, subcutaneously at days 0-2).\nMain Outcomes and Measures : The primary end point was the time from randomization to improvement of at least 1 point on a 7-category disease severity score.\nResults : Of 200 participants, 112 (56%) were men and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 45 (40-55) years.\nThere was random assignment of 100 patients (50%) to the rhG-CSF group and 100 (50%) to the usual care group.\nTime to clinical improvement was similar between groups (rhG-CSF group median of 12 days (IQR, 10-16 days) vs usual care group median of 13 days (IQR, 11-17 days); hazard ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.95-1.71; P\u2009=\u2009.06).\nFor secondary end points, the proportion of patients progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, or septic shock was lower in the rhG-CSF group (rhG-CSF group, 2% vs usual care group, 15%; difference, -13%; 95%CI, -21.4% to -5.4%).\nAt 21 days, 2 patients (2%) had died in the rhG-CSF group compared with 10 patients (10%) in the usual care group (hazard ratio, 0.19; 95%CI, 0.04-0.88).\nAt day 5, the lymphocyte cell count was higher in the rhG-CSF group (rhG-CSF group median of 1050/\u03bcL vs usual care group median of 620/\u03bcL; Hodges-Lehmann estimate of the difference in medians, 440; 95% CI, 380-490).\nSerious adverse events, such as sepsis or septic shock, respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, occurred in 29 patients (14.5%) in the rhG-CSF group and 42 patients (21%) in the usual care group.\nConclusion and Relevance : In preliminary findings from a randomized clinical trial, rhG-CSF treatment for patients with COVID-19 with lymphopenia but no comorbidities did not accelerate clinical improvement, but the number of patients developing critical illness or dying may have been reduced.\nLarger studies that include a broader range of patients with COVID-19 should be conducted.\nTrial Registration : Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR2000030007.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term":
