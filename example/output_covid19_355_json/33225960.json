{"doc_id": "33225960", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Interferon \u03b2-1a (IFN\u03b2-1a) in COVID-19 patients (INTERCOP): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.\nPharmacological therapies of proven efficacy in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are still lacking.\nWe have identified IFN\u03b2-1a as the most promising drug to be repurposed for COVID-19.\nThe rationale relies on the evidence of IFN\u03b2 anti-viral activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 and animal models resembling SARS-CoV-2 infection and on a recent clinical trial where IFN\u03b2 was indicated as the key component of a successful therapeutic combination.\nThis is a randomized, controlled, open-label, monocentric, phase II trial (INTERCOP trial).\nOne hundred twenty-six patients with positive swab detection of SARS-CoV-2, radiological signs of pneumonia, and mild-to-moderate disease will be randomized 2:1 to IFN\u03b2-1a in addition to standard of care vs standard of care alone.\nNo other anti-viral drugs will be used as part of the regimens, both in the control and the intervention arms.\nIFN\u03b2-1a will be administered subcutaneously at the dose of 44 mcg (equivalent to 12 million international units) three times per week, at least 48\u2009h apart, for a total of 2\u00a0weeks.\nThe primary outcome is the time to negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs.\nSecondary outcomes include improvement or worsening in a clinical severity score measured on a 7-point ordinal scale (including transfer to intensive care unit and death), oxygen- and ventilator-free days, mortality, changes in pulmonary computed tomography severity score, hospital stay duration, reduction of viral load measured on nasopharyngeal swabs, number of serious adverse events, and changes in biochemical markers of organ dysfunction.\nExploratory outcomes include blood cell counts, cytokine and inflammatory profile, peripheral mRNA expression profiles of interferon-stimulated genes, and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and to IFN\u03b2-1a.\nINTERCOP is the first study to specifically investigate the clinical benefits of IFN\u03b2-1a in COVID-19 patients.\nPotential implications of this trial are multifaceted: should the primary outcome be fulfilled and the treatment be safe, one may envisage that IFN\u03b2-1a be used to reduce the infectivity of patients with mild-to moderate disease.\nIn case IFN\u03b2-1a reduced the duration of hospital stay and/or ameliorated the clinical status, it may become a cornerstone of COVID-19 treatment.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : EudraCT 2020-002458-25.\nRegistered on May 11, 2020 ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04449380.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "COVID-19", "negation":
