(28\u00a0Days) Compared with Short Course (\u2264\u200910\u00a0Days) in the Prevention of Relapse in Adults Treated for Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection.\nRelapse after complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) remains common after treatment.\nThe optimal antibiotic treatment duration for cIAIs is uncertain, especially in cases where source control is not achieved.\nWe hypothesised that in patients with cIAIs, regardless of source control intervention, there would be a lower relapse rate with long-course antibiotics (28\u00a0days) compared with short course (\u2264\u200910\u00a0days).\nWe piloted a trial comparing \u2264\u200910-day with 28-day antibiotic treatment for cIAI.\nA randomised controlled unblinded feasibility trial was conducted.\nEligible participants were adult patients with a cIAI that were diagnosed \u2264\u20096\u00a0days prior to screening.\nRandomisation was to long-course (28\u00a0days) or short-course (\u226410\u00a0days) antibiotic therapy.\nChoice of antibiotics was determined by the clinical team.\nParticipants were followed up for 90\u00a0days.\nPrimary outcomes were willingness of participants to be randomised and feasibility of trial procedures.\nIn total, 172 patients were screened, 84/172 (48.8%) were eligible, and 31/84 (36.9%) were randomised.\nPatients were assigned to either the short-course arm (18/31, 58.0%) or the long-course arm (13/31, 41.9%).\nOne patient in the short-course arm withdrew after randomisation.\nIn the short-course arm, 4/17 (23.5%) were treated for a cIAI relapse vs 0/13 (0.0%) relapses in the long-course arm.\nProtocol violations included deviations from protocol-assigned antibiotic duration and interruptions to antibiotic therapy.\nThis feasibility study identified opportunities to increase recruitment in a full trial.\nThis study demonstrates completion of a randomised controlled trial to further evaluate if the optimum antibiotic duration for cIAIs is feasible.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03265834.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "cIAIs", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 38, "end": 43}, {"term":
