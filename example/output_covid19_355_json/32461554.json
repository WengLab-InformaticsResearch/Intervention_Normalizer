{"doc_id": "32461554", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Colchicine's effects on metabolic and inflammatory molecules in adults with obesity and metabolic syndrome: results from a pilot randomized controlled trial.\nRecent clinical trials have demonstrated that colchicine may have metabolic and cardiovascular and benefits in at-risk patients; however, the mechanisms through which colchicine may improve outcomes are still unclear.\nWe sought to examine colchicine's effects on circulating inflammatory and metabolic molecules in adults with obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS).\nBlood samples were collected pre- and post-intervention during a double-blind randomized controlled trial in which 40 adults with obesity and MetS were randomized to colchicine 0.6\u2009mg or placebo twice-daily for 3 months.\nSerum samples were analyzed for 1305 circulating factors using the SomaScan Platform.\nThe Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to adjust the false discovery rate (FDR) for multiple testing.\nAt baseline, age (48.0\u2009\u00b1\u200913.8 vs. 44.7\u2009\u00b1\u200910.3 years) and BMI (39.8\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4 vs. 41.8\u2009\u00b1\u20098.2\u2009kg/m2) were not different between groups.\nAfter controlling for the FDR, 34 molecules were significantly changed by colchicine.\nColchicine decreased concentrations of multiple inflammatory molecules, including C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, and resistin, in addition to vascular-related proteins (e.g., oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor, phosphodiesterase 5A).\nConversely, relative to placebo, colchicine significantly increased concentrations of eight molecules including secreted factors associated with metabolism and anti-thrombosis.\nIn adults with obesity, colchicine significantly affected concentrations of proteins involved in the innate immune system, endothelial function and atherosclerosis, uncovering new mechanisms behind its cardiometabolic effects.\nFurther research is warranted to investigate whether colchicine's IL-6 suppressive effects may be beneficial in COVID-19.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "adults", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {},
