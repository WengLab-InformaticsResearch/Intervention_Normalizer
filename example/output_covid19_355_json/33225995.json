{"doc_id": "33225995", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Comparison of four COVID-19 screening strategies to facilitate early case identification within the homeless shelter population: A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.\n1.\nTo compare the effectiveness of four different surveillance strategies in detecting COVID-19 within the homeless shelter population.\n2.\nTo assess the participant adherence over time for each surveillance method.\nTRIAL DESIGN : This is a prospective cluster-randomized study to compare the effectiveness of four different surveillance regimens across eight homeless shelters in the city of Hamilton.\nParticipants will include both residents of, and the staff working within, the homeless shelters.\nAll participants aged 18 or older who consent to the study and are able to collect a swab sample (where relevant) are eligible for the study.\nThe study will take place across eight homeless shelters (four men-only and four women-only) in the City of Hamilton in Ontario, Canada.\nINTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR GROUPS : The comparator group will receive active daily surveillance of symptoms and testing will only be completed in symptomatic participants (i.e. those who fail screening or who seek care for potential COVID-19 related symptoms).\nThe three intervention arms will all receive active daily surveillance of symptoms and testing of symptomatic participants (as in the comparator group) in addition to one of the following: 1.\nOnce weekly self-collected oral swabs (OS) regardless of symptoms using written and visual instructions.\n2.\nOnce weekly self-collected oral-nares swab (O-NS) regardless of symptoms using written and visual instructions.\n3.\nOnce weekly nurse collected nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) regardless of symptoms.\nParticipants will follow verbal and written instructions for the collection of OS and O-NS specimens.\nFor OS collection, participants are instructed to first moisten the swab on their tongue, insert the swab between the cheek and the lower gums and rotate the swab three times.\nThis is repeated on the other side.\nFor O-NS collection, after oral collection, the swab is inserted comfortably (about 2-3 cm) into one nostril, parallel to the floor and turned three times, then repeated in the other nostril.\nNPS specimens were collected by the nurse following standard of care procedure.\nAll swabs were placed into a viral inactivation medium and transported to the laboratory for COVID-19 testing.\nBriefly, total nucleic acid was extracted from specimens and then amplified by RT-PCR for the UTR and Envelope genes of SARS-CoV-2 and the human RNase P gene, which is used as a sample adequacy marker.\nMAIN OUTCOMES : 1.\nPRIMARY OUTCOME : COVID-19 detection rate, i.e. the number of new positive cases over the study period of 8 weeks in each arm of the study.\n2.\nSECONDARY OUTCOMES : Qualitative assessment of study enrollment over 8 weeks.\nPercentage of participants who performed 50% or more of the weekly swabs in the intervention arms in the 8 week study period.\nWe will use a computer-generated random assignment list to randomize the shelters to one of four interventions.\nShelters were stratified by gender, and the simple randomization scheme was applied within each stratum.\nThe randomization scheme was created using WinPEPI.\nThis is an open-label study in which neither participants nor assessors are blinded.\nNUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE) : Since we are including our total sample frame, a sample size estimation at the cluster level is not required.\nHowever, if we succeed to enroll 50 participants per shelter from 8 shelters (n=400), and the detection rate is 3 times higher in the intervention groups (0.15) than in the comparator groups (0.05), we will have 90% power to detect a statistically significant and clinically important difference at a type I error rate of alpha=0.05 (one tailed), assuming an intraclass correlation of ~0.008.\nThese computations were done using WinPEPI, and informed by conservative estimates from other studies on respiratory illness in the homeless (see Full protocol).\nTRIAL STATUS : The protocol version number is 3.0.\nRecruitment began on April 17, 2020 and is ongoing.\nDue to low numbers of COVID cases in the community and shelter system during the initial study period, the trial was extended.\nThe estimated date for the end of the extended recruitment period is Feb 1, 2021.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov on June 18, 2020 with the identifier NCT04438070 .\nFULL PROTOCOL : The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1).\nIn the interest in expediting dissemination of this material, the familiar formatting has been eliminated; this Letter serves as a summary of the key elements of the full protocol.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "homeless shelter population", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 104, "end": 131}, {"term": "homeless shelters",
