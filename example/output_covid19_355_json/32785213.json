{"doc_id": "32785213", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Phase\u00a0I/II study of COVID-19 RNA vaccine BNT162b1 in adults.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1, a pandemic.\nWith rapidly accumulating numbers of cases and deaths reported globally2, a vaccine is urgently needed.\nHere we report the available safety, tolerability and immunogenicity data from an ongoing placebo-controlled, observer-blinded dose-escalation study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04368728) among 45\u00a0healthy adults (18-55\u00a0years of age), who were randomized to receive 2 doses-separated by 21 days-of 10\u00a0\u03bcg, 30\u00a0\u03bcg or 100\u00a0\u03bcg of BNT162b1.\nBNT162b1 is a lipid-nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine that encodes the trimerized receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2.\nLocal reactions and systemic events were dose-dependent, generally mild to moderate, and transient.\nA second vaccination with 100\u00a0\u03bcg was not administered because of the increased reactogenicity and a lack of meaningfully increased immunogenicity after a single dose compared with the 30-\u03bcg dose.\nRBD-binding IgG concentrations and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titres in sera increased with dose level and after a second dose.\nGeometric mean neutralizing titres reached 1.9-4.6-fold that of a panel of COVID-19 convalescent human sera, which were obtained at least 14\u00a0days after a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR.\nThese results support further evaluation of this mRNA vaccine candidate.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "adults", "negation": "affirmed",
