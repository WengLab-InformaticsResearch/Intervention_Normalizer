{"doc_id": "33443580", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Safety, Reactogenicity, and Health-Related Quality of Life After Trivalent Adjuvanted vs Trivalent High-Dose Inactivated Influenza Vaccines in Older Adults: A Randomized Clinical Trial.\nImportance : Trivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV3) and trivalent high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV3) are US-licensed for adults aged 65 years and older.\nData are needed on the comparative safety, reactogenicity, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) effects of these vaccines.\nObjective : To compare safety, reactogenicity, and changes in HRQOL scores after aIIV3 vs HD-IIV3.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants : This randomized blinded clinical trial was a multicenter US study conducted during the 2017 to 2018 and 2018 to 2019 influenza seasons.\nAmong 778 community-dwelling adults aged at least 65 years and assessed for eligibility, 13 were ineligible and 8 withdrew before randomization.\nStatistical analysis was performed from August 2019 to August 2020.\nInterventions : Intramuscular administration of aIIV3 or HD-IIV3 after age-stratification (65-79 years; \u226580 years) and randomization.\nMain Outcomes and Measures : Proportions of participants with moderate-to-severe injection-site pain and 14 other solicited reactions during days 1 to 8, using a noninferiority test (5% noninferiority margin), and serious adverse events (SAE) and adverse events of clinical interest (AECI), including new-onset immune-mediated conditions, during days 1 to 43.\nChanges in HRQOL scores before and after vaccination (days 1, 3) were also compared between study groups.\nResults : A total of 757 adults were randomized, 378 to receive aIIV3 and 379 to receive HD-IIV3.\nOf these participants, there were 420 women (55%) and 589 White individuals (78%) with a median (range) age of 72 (65-97) years.\nThe proportion reporting moderate-to-severe injection-site pain, limiting or preventing activity, after aIIV3 (12 participants [3.2%]) (primary outcome) was noninferior compared with HD-IIV3 (22 participants [5.8%]) (difference -2.7%; 95% CI, -5.8 to 0.4).\nTen reactions met noninferiority criteria for aIIV3; 4 (moderate-to-severe injection-site tenderness, arthralgia, fatigue, malaise) did not.\nIt was inconclusive whether these 4 reactions occurred in higher proportions of participants after aIIV3.\nNo participant sought medical care for a vaccine reaction.\nNo AECI was observed.\nNine participants had at least SAE after aIIV3 (2.4%; 95% CI,1.1% to 4.5%); 3 had at least 1 SAE after HD-IIV3 (0.8%; 95% CI, 0.2% to 2.2%).\nNo SAE was associated with vaccination.\nChanges in prevaccination and postvaccination HRQOL scores were not clinically meaningful and not different between the groups.\nConclusions and Relevance : Overall safety and HRQOL findings were similar after aIIV3 and HD-IIV3, and consistent with prelicensure data.\nFrom a safety standpoint, this study's results support using either vaccine to prevent influenza in older adults.\nTrial Registration : ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03183908.\n", "Evidence
