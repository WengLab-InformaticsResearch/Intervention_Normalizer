{"doc_id": "33803694", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Proposal for a Fitness Program in the School Setting during the COVID 19 Pandemic: Effects of an 8-Week CrossFit Program on Psychophysical Well-Being in Healthy Adolescents.\nThe Italian government promoted social distancing, in which the suspension of any social event, suspension of all activities practiced in gyms, sports centers and their closure was ordered.\nThe social distancing in the school environment and the use of strategies to limit viral infection are not very compatible with group motor activity and team sports.\nThe aim of this study is to verify the effectiveness of a CrossFit program in order to mitigate the deficits in fitness caused by COVID-19 prevention measures and to evaluate the effects on self-efficacy in a group of young adolescents.\nMethods\u02d0 30 healthy participants were randomly allocated into an intervention group (IG) that performed the 8 weeks CrossFit training program or control group (CG).\nPhysical fitness tests (i.e., Squat, push-up, lunge, and 20 m run) and psychological measures Regulatory Emotional Self-Efficacy scale (RESE) were performed at baseline and after 8 weeks.\nResults\u02d0 After 8 weeks, the intervention group showed significant improvements for all fitness tests (p < 0.0001).\nAdditionally, higher scores for the RESE negative and positive (p < 0.0001) scales were found in the intervention group.\nNo statistical differences were found in the control group except for the push up test.\nConclusions\u02d0 the 8-week CrossFit intervention program could positively affect the general physical well-being and improve the emotional perceived self-efficacy in healthy adolescents.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "COVID 19
