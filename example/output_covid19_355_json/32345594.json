{"doc_id": "32345594", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Patients with Cancer Appear More Vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2: A Multicenter Study during the COVID-19 Outbreak.\nThe novel COVID-19 outbreak has affected more than 200 countries and territories as of March 2020.\nGiven that patients with cancer are generally more vulnerable to infections, systematic analysis of diverse cohorts of patients with cancer affected by COVID-19 is needed.\nWe performed a multicenter study including 105 patients with cancer and 536 age-matched noncancer patients confirmed with COVID-19.\nOur results showed COVID-19 patients with cancer had higher risks in all severe outcomes.\nPatients with hematologic cancer, lung cancer, or with metastatic cancer (stage IV) had the highest frequency of severe events.\nPatients with nonmetastatic cancer experienced similar frequencies of severe conditions to those observed in patients without cancer.\nPatients who received surgery had higher risks of having severe events, whereas patients who underwent only radiotherapy did not demonstrate significant differences in severe events when compared with patients without cancer.\nThese findings indicate that patients with cancer appear more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.\nSIGNIFICANCE: Because this is the first large cohort study on this topic, our report will provide much-needed information that will benefit patients with cancer globally.\nAs such, we believe it is extremely important that our study be disseminated widely to alert clinicians and patients.\nThis article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 747.\n\u00a92020 American Association for Cancer Research.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "Cancer Appear",
