{"doc_id": "33278625", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "A five-day course of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 may reduce the duration of illness.\nIvermectin, a US Food and Drug Administration-approved anti-parasitic agent, was found to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication in vitro.\nA randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to determine the rapidity of viral clearance and safety of ivermectin among adult SARS-CoV-2 patients.\nThe trial included 72 hospitalized patients in Dhaka, Bangladesh, who were assigned to one of three groups: oral ivermectin alone (12 mg once daily for 5 days), oral ivermectin in combination with doxycycline (12 mg ivermectin single dose and 200 mg doxycycline on day 1, followed by 100 mg every 12 h for the next 4 days), and a placebo control group.\nClinical symptoms of fever, cough, and sore throat were comparable among the three groups.\nVirological clearance was earlier in the 5-day ivermectin treatment arm when compared to the placebo group (9.7 days vs 12.7 days; p = 0.02), but this was not the case for the ivermectin + doxycycline arm (11.5 days; p = 0.27).\nThere were no severe adverse drug events recorded in the study.\nA 5-day course of ivermectin was found to be safe and effective in treating adult patients with mild COVID-19.\nLarger trials will be needed to confirm these preliminary findings.\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.\nPublished by Elsevier Ltd..
