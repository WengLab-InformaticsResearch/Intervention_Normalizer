Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial Conducted During COVID-19.\nChronic low back pain is the most prevalent chronic pain condition worldwide and access to behavioral pain treatment is limited.\nVirtual reality (VR) is an immersive technology that may provide effective behavioral therapeutics for chronic pain.\nWe aimed to conduct a double-blind, parallel-arm, single-cohort, remote, randomized placebo-controlled trial for a self-administered behavioral skills-based VR program in community-based individuals with self-reported chronic low back pain during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA national online convenience sample of individuals with self-reported nonmalignant low back pain with duration of 6 months or more and with average pain intensity of 4 or more/10 was enrolled and randomized 1:1 to 1 of 2 daily (56-day) VR programs: (1) EaseVRx (immersive pain relief skills VR program); or (2) Sham VR (2D nature content delivered in a VR headset).\nObjective device use data and self-reported data were collected.\nThe primary outcomes were the between-group effect of EaseVRx versus Sham VR across time points, and the between-within interaction effect representing the change in average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, stress, mood, and sleep over time (baseline to end-of-treatment at day 56).\nSecondary outcomes were global impression of change and change in physical function, sleep disturbance, pain self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing, pain acceptance, pain medication use, and user satisfaction.\nAnalytic methods included intention-to-treat and a mixed-model framework.\nThe study sample was 179 adults (female: 76.5%, 137/179; Caucasian: 90.5%, 162/179; at least some college education: 91.1%, 163/179; mean age: 51.5 years [SD 13.1]; average pain intensity: 5/10 [SD 1.2]; back pain duration \u22655 years: 67%, 120/179).\nNo group differences were found for any baseline variable or treatment engagement.\nUser satisfaction ratings were higher for EaseVRx versus Sham VR (P<.001).\nFor the between-groups factor, EaseVRx was superior to Sham VR for all primary outcomes (highest P value=.009), and between-groups Cohen d effect sizes ranged from 0.40 to 0.49, indicating superiority was moderately clinically meaningful.\nFor EaseVRx, large pre-post effect sizes ranged from 1.17 to 1.3 and met moderate to substantial clinical importance for reduced pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, mood, and stress.\nBetween-group comparisons for Physical Function and Sleep Disturbance showed superiority for the EaseVRx group versus the Sham VR group (P=.022 and .013, respectively).\nPain catastrophizing, pain self-efficacy, pain acceptance, prescription opioid use (morphine milligram equivalent) did not reach statistical significance for either group.\nUse of over-the-counter analgesic use was reduced for EaseVRx (P<.01) but not for Sham VR.\nEaseVRx had high user satisfaction and superior and clinically meaningful symptom reduction for average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, mood, and stress compared to sham VR.\nAdditional research is needed to determine durability of treatment effects and to characterize mechanisms of treatment effects.\nHome-based VR may expand access to effective and on-demand nonpharmacologic treatment for chronic low back pain.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04415177; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04415177.\nINTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID) : RR2-10.2196/25291.\n\u00a9Laura M
