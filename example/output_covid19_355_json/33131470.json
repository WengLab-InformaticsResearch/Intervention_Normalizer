{"doc_id": "33131470", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "[Proactive anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant therapy in the treatment of advanced stages of novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19).\nCase Series and Study Design: COLchicine versus ruxolitinib and secukinumab in open prospective randomIzed trial (COLORIT)].\nThe article is devoted to the treatment of the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the advanced stages of the disease.\nThe types of response of the immune system to the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 with the start of the inflammation process are considered.\nThe situation is analyzed in detail in which the growing autoimmune inflammation (up to the development of a \"cytokine storm\") affects not only the pulmonary parenchyma, but also the endothelium of the small vessels of the lungs.\nSimultaneous damage to the alveoli and microthrombosis of the pulmonary vessels are accompanied by a progressive impairment of gas exchange, the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, the treatment of which, even with the use of invasive ventilation, is ineffective and does not really change the prognosis of patients with COVID-19.\nIn order to interrupt the pathological process at the earliest stages of the disease, the necessity of proactive anti-inflammatory therapy in combination with active anticoagulation treatment is substantiated.\nThe results of the first randomized studies on the use of inhibitors of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (interleukin-6 (tocilizumab), interleukin-17 (secukinumab), Janus kinase blockers, through which the signal is transmitted to cells (ruxolitinib)), which have potential in the early treatment of COVID- 19.\nThe use of a well-known anti-inflammatory drug colchicine (which is used for gout treatment) in patients with COVID-19 is considered.\nThe design of the original COLORIT comparative study on the use of colchicine, ruxolitinib and secukinumab in the treatment of COVID-19 is presented.\nClinical series presented, illustrated early anti-inflammatory therapy together with anticoagulants in patients with COVID-19 and the dangers associated with refusing to initiate such therapy on time.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "advanced stages of novel coronavirus infection", "negation": "affirmed",
