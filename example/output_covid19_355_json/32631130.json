aimed to evaluate the feasibility and clinical utility of training intensive psychiatric community care team members to serve as \"mobile interventionists\" who engage patients in recovery-oriented texting exchanges.\nA 3-month pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare the mobile interventionist approach as an add-on to assertive community treatment (ACT) versus ACT alone.\nParticipants were 49 individuals with serious mental illness (62% with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder, 24% with bipolar disorder, and 14% with depression).\nClinical outcomes were evaluated at baseline, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up, and satisfaction was evaluated posttreatment.\nThe intervention appeared feasible (95% of participants assigned to the mobile interventionist arm initiated the intervention, texting on 69% of possible days and averaging four messages per day), acceptable (91% reported satisfaction), and safe (no adverse events reported).\nExploratory posttreatment clinical effect estimations suggested greater reductions in the severity of paranoid thoughts (Cohen's d=-0.61) and depression (d=-0.59) and improved illness management (d=0.31) and recovery (d=0.23) in the mobile interventionist group.\nAugmentation of care with a texting mobile interventionist proved to be feasible, acceptable, safe, and clinically promising.\nThe findings are encouraging given the relative ease of training practitioners to serve as mobile interventionists, the low burden placed on patients and practitioners, and the simplicity of the technology.\nThe technical resources are widely accessible to patients and practitioners, boding well for potential intervention scalability.\nWhen pandemics such as COVID-19 block the possibility of in-person patient-provider contact, evidence-based texting interventions can serve a crucial role in supporting continuity of care.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term":
