{"doc_id": "32943404", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Intravenous methylprednisolone pulse as a treatment for hospitalised severe COVID-19 patients: results from a randomised controlled clinical trial.\nThere are no determined treatment agents for severe COVID-19.\nIt is suggested that methylprednisolone, as an immunosuppressive treatment, can reduce the inflammation of the respiratory system in COVID-19 patients.\nWe conducted a single-blind, randomised controlled clinical trial involving severe hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 at the early pulmonary phase of the illness in Iran.\nThe patients were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio by the block randomisation method to receive standard care with methylprednisolone pulse (intravenous injection, 250\u2005mg\u00b7day-1 for 3\u2005days) or standard care alone.\nThe study end-point was the time of clinical improvement or death, whichever came first.\nPrimary and safety analysis was done in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population.\n68 eligible patients underwent randomisation (34 patients in each group) from April 20, 2020 to June 20, 2020.\nIn the standard care group, six patients received corticosteroids by the attending physician before the treatment and were excluded from the overall analysis.\nThe percentage of improved patients was higher in the methylprednisolone group than in the standard care group (94.1% versus 57.1%) and the mortality rate was significantly lower in the methylprednisolone group (5.9% versus 42.9%; p<0.001).\nWe demonstrated that patients in the methylprednisolone group had a significantly increased survival time compared with patients in the standard care group (log-rank test: p<0.001; hazard ratio 0.293, 95% CI 0.154-0.556).\nTwo patients (5.8%) in the methylprednisolone group and two patients (7.1%) in the standard care group showed severe adverse events between initiation of treatment and the end of the study.\nOur results suggest that methylprednisolone pulse could be an efficient therapeutic agent for hospitalised severe COVID-19 patients at the pulmonary phase.\nCopyright \u00a9ERS 2020.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment":
