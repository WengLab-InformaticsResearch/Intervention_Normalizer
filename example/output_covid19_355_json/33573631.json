{"doc_id": "33573631", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "The effect of online multimedia psychoeducational interventions on the resilience and perceived stress of hospitalized patients with COVID-19: a pilot cluster randomized parallel-controlled trial.\nThere is evidence suggesting that quarantine might have undesirable psychological impacts on the patients.\nTherefore, it is important to seek for ways to increase the resilience and alleviate the psychological pressure of the patients who are quarantined due to infection with COVID-19.\nThe present study was conducted to assess an online multimedia psychoeducational intervention regarding the feasibility, adherence, patient satisfaction and effectiveness on resilience and perceived stress of patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19.\nThis was a pilot cluster randomized parallel-controlled trial with hospital wards as the units of randomization.\nParticipants in this fully online trial were 50 consecutive patients who were hospitalized in 2 hospitals in Shiraz, after being diagnosed with COVID-19.\nBefore the beginning of the intervention, four inpatient wards inside two of the hospitals were randomly assigned to either intervention or control conditions.\nAll eligible participants in the wards allocated to the intervention condition received online multimedia psychoeducational interventions during the 2\u2009weeks, whilst the patients in the wards allocated to the control condition were offered the opportunity to receive telephone-based psychological counseling if needed.\nPsychoeducational interventions mainly included cognitive-behavioural techniques, stress management techniques, mindfulness-based stress reduction and positive psychotherapy.\nThe patients were assessed regarding resilience and perceived stress at baseline and after two weeks.\nOf 27 patients starting multimedia psychoeducational interventions, 26 (96.29%) completed post-assessments.\nA high level of adherence (80.76%) and satisfaction (Mean\u2009=\u200929.42; SD\u2009=\u20094.18) with the online multimedia psychoeducational interventions was found.\nCompared with the control group, the patients who used online multimedia psychoeducational interventions reported greater resilience (Meanintervention\u2009=\u200981.74; Meancontrol\u2009=\u200972.86; adjusted t (46)\u2009=\u20092.10; p\u2009=\u20090.04; CI: 0.39 to 17.38; dppc2\n\u2009=\u20090.83) and fewer perceived stress (Meanintervention\u2009=\u200922.15; Meancontrol\u2009=\u200929.45; adjusted t (46)\u2009=\u20092.66; p\u2009=\u20090.01; CI: -\u200912.81 to -\u20091.78; dppc2\n\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.77) after 2\u2009weeks.\nThe findings of the present study provided a successful first attempt at implementing feasible online multimedia psychoeducational interventions to promote resilience and mitigate stress among the patients who were hospitalized due to infection with COVID-19.\nThe present results could help mental health professionals to determine which psychological techniques should be emphasized to promote patients' resilience in the context of COVID-19 disease.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : Iranian Registry of Clinical
