{"doc_id": "32928122", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Time to adapt in the pandemic era: a prospective randomized non -inferiority study comparing time to intubate with and without the barrier box.\nThe challenges posed by the spread of COVID-19 disease through aerosols have compelled anesthesiologists to modify their airway management practices.\nDevices such as barrier boxes are being considered as potential adjuncts to full PPE's to limit the aerosol spread.\nUsage of the barrier box raises concerns of delay in time to intubate (TTI).\nWe designed our study to determine if using a barrier box with glidescope delays TTI within acceptable parameters to make relevant clinical conclusions.\nSeventy-eight patients were enrolled in this prospective non-inferiority controlled trial and were randomly allocated to either group C (without the barrier box) or the study group BB (using barrier box).\nThe primary measured endpoint is time to intubate (TTI), which is defined as time taken from loss of twitches confirmed with a peripheral nerve stimulator to confirmation of end-tidal CO 2.\n15\u2009s was used as non-inferiority margin for the purpose of the study.\nWe used an unpaired two-sample single-sided t-test to test our non- inferiority hypothesis (H 0: Mean TTI diff \u226515\u2009s, H A: Mean TTI diff <\u200915\u2009s).\nSecondary endpoints include the number of attempts at intubation, lowest oxygen saturation during induction, and the need for bag-mask ventilation.\nMean TTI in group C was 42\u2009s (CI 19.2 to 64.8) vs. 52.1\u2009s (CI 26.1 to 78) in group BB.\nThe difference in mean TTI was 10.1\u2009s (CI -\u221e to 14.9).\nWe rejected the null hypothesis and concluded with 95% confidence that the difference of the mean TTI between the groups is less than <\u200915\u2009s (95% CI -\u221e to 14.9,p\u2009=\u20090.0461).\nOur induction times were comparable (67.7 vs. 65.9\u2009s).100% of our patients were intubated on the first attempt in both groups.\nNone of our patients needed rescue breaths.\nWe conclude that in patients with normal airway exam, scheduled for elective surgeries, our barrier box did not cause any clinically significant delay in TTI when airway manipulation is performed by well-trained providers.\nThe study was retrospectively registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04411056) on May 27, 2020.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "normal airway exam", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 34, "end": 52}, {"term": "elective surgeries", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {},
