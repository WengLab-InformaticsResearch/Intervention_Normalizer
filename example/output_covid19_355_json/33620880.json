{"doc_id": "33620880", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Negative-Pressure Isolation Mask for Endoscopic Examination During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: A Randomized Controlled Trial.\nDuring the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, endoscopists have high risks of exposure to exhaled air from patients during gastroscopy.\nTo minimize this risk, we transformed the oxygen mask into a fully closed negative-pressure gastroscope isolation mask.\nThis study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and feasibility of use of this mask during gastroscopy.\nFrom February 28, 2020, to March 10, 2020, 320 patients undergoing gastroscopy were randomly assigned into the mask group (n = 160) or conventional group (n = 160).\nPatients in the mask group wore the isolation mask during gastroscopy, whereas patients in the conventional group did not wear the mask.\nThe adenosine triphosphate fluorescence and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in patients' exhaled air were measured to reflect the degree of environmental pollution by exhaled air.\nPatients' vital signs, operation time, and adverse events during endoscopy were also evaluated.\nFour patients were excluded because of noncooperation or incomplete data.\nA total of 316 patients were included in the final analysis.\nThe difference between the highest CO2 concentration around patients' mouth and CO2 concentration in the environment was significantly decreased in the mask group compared with the conventional group.\nThere was no significant difference in the adenosine triphosphate fluorescence, vital signs, and operation time between the 2 groups.\nNo severe adverse events related to the isolation mask, endoscopy failure, or new coronavirus infection during follow-up were recorded.\nThis new isolation mask showed excellent feasibility of use and safety compared with routine gastroscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCopyright \u00a9 2021
