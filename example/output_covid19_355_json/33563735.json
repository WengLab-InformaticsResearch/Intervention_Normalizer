Wounds were surgically treated each day and heal spontaneously.\nPeriodical control exams were performed.\nWound healing did not present any statistically significant differences between groups (group A: 69\u00b121.97 and B: 61\u00b122.13 days, t=-1.22; p=0.11).\nNo statistically significant differences (p<0.05) between groups A and B in wound healing regarding to gender or cigarette use was noted.\nNo significant differences in amputation treatment between the 2 comparative groups were noted.\nNo confirmed COVID-19 infections in medical staff who performed surgical interventions or in treated patients were detected.\nCopyright: \u00a9 Saudi Medical Journal.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "pandemic of COVID-19", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 45, "end": 65}, {"term": "diabetic", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 46, "end": 54}, {"term": "medical staff", "negation": "negated", "UMLS": {}, "start": 36, "end": 49}, {"term": "surgical interventions", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 64, "end": 86}, {"term": "treated patients", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 93, "end": 109}], "Comparison Results": [], "Study Arm 1 Results": [], "Study Arm 2 Results": [], "Hypothesis": []}, "Sentence-level breakdown": [{"Section": "TITLE", "Text": "Challenges in diabetic foot treatment during pandemic of COVID-19 .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "pandemic of COVID-19", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 45, "end": 65}], "Intervention": [{"term": "diabetic foot treatment", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 14, "end": 37, "has_procedure": [{"text": "diabetic foot treatment", "maps_to": "C0087111:treatment", "start": 0, "end": 23}], "has_relation": "N/A"}], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "OBJECTIVES", "Text": "To avoid hospital spread of Coronavirus-2019 ( COVID-19 ) and to analyze out of hospital outcomes after amputation .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [{"term": "hospital", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 9, "end": 17}, {"term": "out of hospital outcomes", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 73, "end": 97}], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "METHODS", "Text": "Prospective analysis of data obtained from 60 diabetic patients in 2020 was performed at Cantonal Hospital Zenica , Zenica , Bosnia and Herzegovina .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [{"term": "diabetic", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 46, "end": 54}], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "METHODS", "Text": "Personal protection equipment included double surgical mask , glasses , disposable surgical coats , and surgical masks for patients .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [{"term": "double", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 39, "end": 45, "has_relation": "N/A"}, {"term": "mask", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 55, "end": 59, "has_device": [{"text": "mask", "maps_to": "C0024861:mask", "start": 0, "end": 4}], "has_relation": "N/A"}, {"term": "glasses", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 62, "end": 69, "has_device": [{"text": "glasses", "maps_to": "C0015421:glasses", "start": 0, "end": 7}], "has_relation": "N/A"}, {"term": "disposable surgical coats", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 72, "end": 97, "has_device": [{"text": "disposable", "maps_to": "C0725865:disposable", "start": 0, "end": 10}], "has_relation": "N/A"}, {"term": "surgical", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {}, "start": 46, "end": 54, "has_relation": "N/A"}], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "METHODS", "Text": "Swabs were used to take samples from wounds .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "METHODS", "Text": "We randomly divided patients in 2 groups of 30 patients each .", "Evidence Elements": {"Participant": [], "Intervention": [], "Outcome": [], "Observation": [], "Count": []}, "Evidence Propositions": []}, {"Section": "METHODS", "Text": "In pre-operative treatment , we used local anesthesia lidocaine hydrochloride 2 % ( Belupo , Koprivnica , Croatia ) in group A and systemic analgesia intravenous tramadol chloride 100 mg intravenous ( Krka , Novo Mesto , Slovenia ) in group B .
