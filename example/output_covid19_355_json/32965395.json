{"doc_id": "32965395", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Rationale and design of the \"Tocilizumab in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19: an open-label multicentre randomized controlled\" trial (TOCIBRAS).\nPro-inflammatory markers play a significant role in the disease severity of patients with COVID-19.\nThus, anti-inflammatory therapies are attractive agents for potentially combating the uncontrolled inflammatory cascade in these patients.\nWe designed a trial testing tocilizumab versus standard of care intending to improve the outcomes by inhibiting interleukin-6, an important inflammatory mediator in COVID-19.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS : This open-label multicentre randomized controlled trial will compare clinical outcomes of tocilizumab plus standard of care versus standard of care alone in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19.\nTwo of the following four criteria are required for protocol enrolment: D-dimer > 1,000ng/mL; C reactive protein > 5mg/dL, ferritin > 300mg/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase > upper limit of normal.\nThe primary objective will be to compare the clinical status on day 15, as measured by a 7-point ordinal scale applied in COVID-19 trials worldwide.\nThe primary endpoint will be assessed by an ordinal logistic regression assuming proportional odds ratios adjusted for stratification variables (age and sex).\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION : The TOCIBRAS protocol was approved by local and central (national) ethical committees in Brazil following current national and international guidelines/directives.\nEach participating center had the study protocol approved by their institutional review boards before initiating protocol enrolment.\nThe data derived from this trial will be published regardless of the results.\nIf proven active, this strategy could alleviate the consequences of the inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients and improve their clinical outcomes.\n",
