key approaches to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission would be to reduce the titres of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva of infected COVID-19 patients.\nThis is particularly important in high-risk procedures like dental treatment.\nThe present randomized control trial evaluated the efficacy of three commercial mouth-rinse viz.\npovidone-iodine (PI), chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), in reducing the salivary SARS-CoV-2 viral load in COVID-19 patients compared with water.\nA total of 36 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were recruited, of which 16 patients were randomly assigned to four groups-PI group (n\u2009=\u20094), CHX group (n\u2009=\u20096), CPC group (n\u2009=\u20094) and water as control group (n\u2009=\u20092).\nSaliva samples were collected from all patients at baseline and at 5\u00a0min, 3\u00a0h and 6\u00a0h post-application of mouth-rinses/water.\nThe samples were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR analysis.\nComparison of salivary Ct values of patients within each group of PI, CHX, CPC and water at 5\u00a0min, 3\u00a0h and 6\u00a0h time points did not show any significant differences.\nHowever, when the Ct value fold change of each of the mouth-rinse group patients were compared with the fold change of water group patients at the respective time points, a significant increase was observed in the CPC group patients at 5\u00a0min and 6\u00a0h and in the PI group patients at 6\u00a0h.\nThe effect of decreasing salivary load with CPC and PI mouth-rinsing was observed to be sustained at 6\u00a0h time point.\nWithin the limitation of the current study, as number of the samples analyzed, the use of CPC and PI formulated that commercial mouth-rinses may be useful as a pre-procedural rinse to help reduce the transmission of COVID-19.\nISRCTN (ISRCTN95933274), 09/09/20, retrospectively registered.\n", "Evidence Map": {"Enrollment": [{"term": "SARS-CoV-2-positive", "negation": "affirmed", "UMLS": {},
