of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.\nPrimary objective: To determine the efficacy of a candidate antiviral on time to virological cure compared to standard of care within 14 days of randomisation Secondary objectives: \u2022 To determine the safety of the antiviral \u2022 To determine the clinical benefit of the antiviral over placebo according to the WHO 7-point ordinal scale \u2022 To determine the clinical benefit of the antiviral over placebo on time to resolution of clinical symptoms \u2022 To determine the effect of the antiviral over placebo on biomarkers of inflammation and immune activation TRIAL DESIGN: This is a multi-centre, triple-blind, randomised placebo controlled phase II, 2-arm trial with parallel-group design with allocation ratio 1:1.\nInclusion Criteria: \u2022 Provision of informed consent by the participant \u2022 Age \u226518 years \u2022 Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 by nucleic acid testing in the past 5 days \u2022 COVID-19 related symptom initiation within 5 days \u2022 Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening.\nFemale patients of childbearing potential and fertile male patients who are sexually active with a female of childbearing potential must use highly effective methods of contraception throughout the study and for 1 week following the last dose of study treatment.\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA : \u2022 Known allergy to the study medication \u2022 Is on another clinical trial investigating an antiviral treatment for COVID-19 \u2022 Pregnancy \u2022 Patients with severe hepatic dysfunction equivalent to Grade C in the Child-Pugh classification \u2022 Patients with renal impairment requiring dialysis \u2022 Is deemed by the Investigator to be ineligible for any reason Participants will be recruited from, and the study visits will take place at Alfred Hospital, Monash Health, Austin Health in Victoria, Australia for hospitalised participants as well as recruitment in the community in participants homes for eligible people not requiring hospitalisation.\nINTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR : The first candidate antiviral is favipiravir Arm 1: Favipiravir 1800 mg favipiravir BD on Day 1 followed by 800 mg BD favipiravir for the next 13 days.\nArm 2: Placebo MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary outcome: Time to virological cure as defined by 2 successive throat (or combined nose/throat) swabs negative for SARS-CoV-2 by nucleic acid testing during the 14 days after enrolment.\nRandomisation performed at the Alfred Hospital Clinical Trials Pharmacy using computer generated block-randomisation lists with 6 participants per block.\nWithin each block half of the participants will be randomised to the candidate antiviral and the other half to placebo.\nRandomisation is stratified by study site, with participants enrolled in the community considered as a study site.\nBLINDING (MASKING) : Study participants, study investigators and the study statistician will be blinded to treatment allocation.\nNUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE) : The study aims to recruit 190 people (95/arm) with the first candidate antiviral favipiravir TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version 2.0 Dated 31-Jul-2020.\nRecruitment will take place between July 2020 and December 2020.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : clinicaltrials.gov NCT04445467 First posted 24-Jun-2020 FULL PROTOCOL: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1).\nIn the interest in expediting dissemination of this material, the familiar
