The primary endpoint is the clinical status at Day 15 on the 7-point ordinal scale of the WHO Master Protocol (V.3.0, 3 March 2020).\nThis trial involves patients hospitalised in conventional departments or intensive care units both from academic or non-academic hospitals throughout Europe.\nA sample size of 3100 patients (620 patients per arm) is targeted.\nThis trial has begun on 22 March 2020.\nSince 5 April 2020, DisCoVeRy has been an add-on trial of the Solidarity consortium of trials conducted by the WHO in Europe and worldwide.\nOn 8 June 2020, 754 patients have been included.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION : Inserm is the sponsor of DisCoVeRy.\nEthical approval has been obtained from the institutional review board on 13 March 2020 (20.03.06.51744) and from the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) on 9 March 2020.\nResults will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER : NCT04315948 Eudra-CT 2020-000936-23.\n\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.
