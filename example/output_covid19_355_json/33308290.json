{"doc_id": "33308290", "type of study": "Therapy", "title": "", "abstract": "Death Caf\u00e9s for prevention of burnout in intensive care unit employees: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial (STOPTHEBURN).\nBurnout is an occupational syndrome that leads to mental health problems, job turnover, and patient safety events.\nThose caring for critically ill patients are especially susceptible due to high patient mortality, long hours, and regular encounters with trauma and ethical issues.\nInterventions to prevent burnout in this population are needed.\nPreliminary studies suggest debriefing sessions may reduce burnout.\nThis study aims to assess whether participation in regular debriefing can prevent burnout in intensive care unit (ICU) clinicians.\nA randomized controlled trial will be conducted in two large academic medical centers.\nTwo hundred ICU clinicians will be recruited with target enrollment of 100 physicians and 100 non-physicians (nurses, pharmacists, therapists).\nParticipants must have worked in the ICU for the equivalent of at least 1 full time work week in the preceding 4\u2009weeks.\nEnrolled subjects will be randomized to virtually attend biweekly debriefing sessions facilitated by a psychotherapist for 3\u2009months or to a control arm without sessions.\nOur debriefs are modeled after Death Caf\u00e9s, which are informal discussions focusing on death, dying, loss, grief, and illness.\nThese sessions allow for reflection on distressing events and offer community and collaboration among hospital employees outside of work.\nThe primary outcome is clinician burnout as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) Score.\nSecondary outcomes include depression and anxiety, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ-8) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), respectively.\nQuestionnaires will be administered prior to the intervention, at 1\u2009month, at 3\u2009months, and at 6\u2009months after enrollment.\nThese values will be compared between groups temporally.\nQualitative feedback will also be collected and analyzed.\nWith ICU clinician burnout rates exceeding 50%, Death Caf\u00e9 debriefing sessions may prove to be an effective tool to avert this debilitating syndrome.\nWith COVID-19 limiting social interactions and overloading ICUs worldwide, the virtual administration of the Death Caf\u00e9 for ICU clinicians provides an innovative strategy to potentially mitigate burnout in this vulnerable population.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION : ClinicalTrials.gov
